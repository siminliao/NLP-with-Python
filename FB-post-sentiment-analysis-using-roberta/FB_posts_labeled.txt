I add shredded cheddar cheese to the soup when i serve it, or popcorn.  Now personally, I LOVE the bean and bacon soup. It is a home comfort thing. My mom and I would have it with tuna sandwiches that had a crisp piece of lettuce.  Also the cream of potato, my mom would add potatoes to it for me..but I asked for this a lot. And anytime my folks, or myself or our kids have been sick, it's the good ol chicken noodle soup that makes them feel better instantly. Some more comfort food.

125472670805257_499203650098822	My name is Arlene Bruno. I live in Florida. I wanted to tell you how Delta Airlines treated a Military family that was trying to fly home to see her grand mother who is in hospices in her last stage of breast cancer. It would completely amaze you how Delta treated them. Over the name on a ticket. My daughter and son n law are stationed in Califorina with the Navy. They have two small children. One is 1.5 the other is 3 mths. She wanted to come out to see my mother before she passed but could not buy the tickets. So I paid for half and she paid for half. We also decided that we could cut the cost if we drove to main airports. So I drove 2.5 hours to Orlando. She drove 3 hours to LAX. When she got there she wanted to be honest with Delta ( which turned out to be our mistake) and tell them that her husband was not able to get leave and that she would be traveling with the two children alone. That she would just use her husbands seat for her son who is 1.5. He would have been setting in his farther lap anyway. They told her that she could not do that becuase her sons name was not on the ticket.....but her son was listed for travel. So she asked if they could just transfer the ticket to her sons name. They said no. They told her.... that she would have to buy her son another ticket. Now we bought these two tickets for a little over 600.00. They wanted 900.00 to buy the same seat that we had already bought again for the same child to set in. It took a lot of talking but we finally decided ok...we will just charge it on a card and go. They cancelled my son n laws ticket .......then told us that all the seats had been sold. They could not give my grandson a ticket because they had over booked the flight with 5 people and as soon as she cx my son n laws ticket one of the other over booked people got his seat. So they could not get on the flight.  She asked if they could get on a later flight today. They told her it was booked but that her and her 2 kids could come back 3 hours before the flight ( which is a 11 tonight )and wait around to see if a seat become open. That would cost 700.00 more. So her and her family made the 3 hour trip home and I made 2.5 hour trip home. We are out of 600.00 and she will not be able to see her grandmother.	0	1	0

So it cost me $2.50 just to shop there. They have power but no register so every product code is hand written.  We grabbed some stuff on sale but we didn't have our club card so no discount. Are you friggin kidding me? There are many other stores in the same shape. But they tell you as you go in about only taking cash before you spend 20 min shopping and 20 min in line for the reg.

Lied and told me no we don't have those games didn't even look. I go home place them on hold using in store pick up and now you magically had them. The guy is a liar and so are 95 percent of your employees. I'm sick being treated badly as a customer cause your employees show no respect except to there friends.

Every time we have parked there we have restocked our truck with food and usually spend at least 80.00 to 150.00.  Why do you not let truckers park at the end of the lot anymore?

A couple weeks ago I purchased 40- $25 gift cards online -- because I thought it would be easier than waiting for them to be activated one by one in the store.  UPS made an attempt to deliver them a week ago last Tuesday.  Because a signature was required and there was no one at my house he left a note saying a second attempt would be made the next day.  The next day he came and searched his truck for 30 minutes.  They were gone.  I immediately called Target and reported this.  I was told to wait a day. And the next day, told to wait another day...and the next day it escalated to a supervisor who asked if I could wait another day.  It was only after I finally said ""THEY ARE GONE. They are not going to show up!  I can continue to wait but a thief is probably spending them!"" that someone decided to check.  Lo and Behold - $700 worth of cards had been spent.  I received an email from guest services saying   ""we cancelled the remaining 12 but the others have been spent.  We are so sorry.  We will send you an egift card for $300."" Seriously?!  I responded that I thought I should be reimbursed the entire amount since I never received the gift cards...to which I received another response today ""it is unfortunate.  They were spent.  We can only give you a $300 egift card. We hope you visit Target.com again real soon."" Am I the one who is confused? I NEVER RECEIVED THESE CARDS! I never signed for these cards.   "	0	1	0

The gentleman walks away & the pharmacist looks at me & says ""we're closed"". I say ""even to answer a quick question?"" She makes an annoyed sound & says ""what"". I say nevermind & start walking away and comment ""nice customer service skills"" & her response it to laugh. SERIOUSLY!!!!!!!!!! I would lose my job if I treated a guest that way.

17648521247_10151228113171248	"Status Update By Math Is Not Greek Tutoring I admit to being frustrated with the logic of math and it's implications on my wallet today. It's a bit of a story, so bear with me. A few weeks ago, I had a coupon for $10 off anything at Kohls. I went seeking a gift which they did not have, so I bought a package of socks and a 2pack of tights. for her. They were buy one get one free. Their computer deducted the appropriate amount off of each on my purchase receipt. Arriving home, I realize I had erroneously purchased the age size, not the shoe size. My daughter is NOT 10-14 yrs of age. So I went back today intending to do an even exchange of the 2pack brown/pink for another in the right size. DID THEY HAVE HER SIZE? NO. Ok, so I was wanting to get some white ones too. I picked a 2 pk of white in her size and proceeded to the counter, realized while waiting in line that they were smudged with dirt in one corner. Told the clerk I'd be right back with another pair. No more pairs, rounded the sock rack and found the only other white 2pck in her size...(whew, they were clean). Back I went to the counter, only to be told by the clerk that she would have to do a return and new purchase. Slightly confused I asked why? oh, These are a different price. (looked identical to me, but sure enough, the clean tights cost 2$ less than the smudged ones. She started the transaction telling me I'd owe her $2.71. WHAT!!!. I'm buying tights that cost 2$ LESS and now have to pay extra? Oh, b/c they don't refund the $10/off coupon. GRRRRRRR. So I understand the math, but talk about IRRITATING!! So I did an EVEN EXCHANGE with the SMUDGED DIRTY TIGHTS so that I didn't have to pay more money. Don't you agree that even though the math makes sense, they have a problem with their customer service?"	0	1	0

I asked why they would close my credit and the reason was that the account number they used was closed. Of course it was closed which is why I used their web site to add my new account information.

Since they had a branch located very close to my home, I opened the account. Did not however receive any $50.00. I asked monthly for most of last year and was told ""I'll check into that for you sir"".Just last week I checked again with a new service person, the one who opened the account for me had of course been transferred. Very nice young man, who talked with the higher ups at the central bank and informed me that ""Too much time has elapsed. We cannot do anything about this, sorry"" Well, I can do something about this. Such a small amount of money, really a meaningless amount is not the issue of course. It is the integrity of the bank that is at issue.

The only similar thing in girls are the french terry pants which are very thin which are $12.99. Do you think girls don't get cold or what? And why is there not a similarly priced piece in the girl's section? The pants you deem comparable are DOUBLE the boy's. And the ""sweats"" I have found in the girl's section, while are furry on the inside, are not very warm because they are capri length and the fabric feels awful(not to mention full of sparkles and colors). While my daughter and I will just purchase the boy's sweats, she was looking for purple and turquoise and you did not make any. Is this only happening in the stores by me in NJ?

125472670805257_474553789230475	"This Friday I had the pleasure of meeting a couple I think you should know about. I was in Laguardia waiting for a connecting flight to Portland Maine. They had been stranded since the day before because their flight was cancelled. They were trying to get on the standby list for my flight. I believe they said they were coming to Maine to await the birth of their grandchild. After many delays, my flight was cancelled as were many others. The only other Portland flight was at 10:30 that night and it was booked solid. This couple heard me talking about my son being sick and I really needed to get home because his  9th birthday was the next day. I ended up booking a flight to Boston as  did they. They got an earlier flight. When they were about to board, they saw me still waiting and offered to give up their seats so I could get home to my kids. Luckily I was on the standby list and got on the same plane. After arriving in Boston, I ran into them again and they offered to drive me to Portland in their rental so I wouldn't have to wait for the bus. I took the bus but thought that it was so nice of them to offer. I don't recall their names, but the last name started with S and they were on the same NYC to Boston flight as me so you guys could probably figure it out. You should give them free tickets or something. It was really nice to see strangers that actually care. It gives me hope for the human race."	0	0	1

12699262021_10150539168202022	"Best Buy...Your Aurora, CO warehouse and delivery team has treated me like dirt, lied to me and cost me 5 hours on my only day off. I spent $3500 of my hard earned cash on a top of the line LG washer and dryer to be delivered. I had to schedule it out 11 days due to my schedule. I was put last on the list. The dryer was installed but didn't work. The install team blamed the cord. They tried a new cord, same result. The install team said it was an internal issue with the dryer. They brought the machine back to the warehouse saying they would bring a NEW machine back Monday. The warehouse called and said the install team said to me that it was my house and there was nothing we could do since the new machine drew more power than my old one. After much debate the rep read me the required specs...identical to what my home has and what my old dryer requires. So after all of this I'm being delivered a defective piece on Monday. Bad form Best Buy. Screwing me out of 5 hours and $3500 is not cool. FYI I've disputed the charge with AMEX. If I do not have a new dryer or my old washer back in the same condition it left and your washer removed by Monday, 1/16/12 at 8 AM MST I will end up with a free washer...a $1750 value. While the gift would be appreciated it isn't worth the time I've had wasted on my end. Make this right. Even if made right I will not be making another Best Buy purchase. I plan to spend at least $10,000 on electronics, computers, software and appliances in '12, this being $3500 of that. I will be making this known to everybody I can...including the 5,565,241 people that ""like"" your page. Please contact me to let me know how you want to make this fair."	0	1	0

Went the other day to cash his check that he endorsed. They told me no, because they don't have his confirmation that he wants them to give me the cash... isn't that why we have ""joint"" checking?? So I tell them fine, just deposit it then and I'll go to the ATM and get it out. They tell me they wont even deposit it, I have to go to the ATM to deposit the check because I have a free checking account, which doesn't qualify for use of the tellers. Fine... I go to the ATM. It takes his check. Doesn't let me pull it out in cash. I drive back through the teller line, ask them wtf, they say it takes a full day to clear... I'm like, it's a BOA check! It's YOUR check, just transfer funds from one account to another, how hard is that?? So they say they have no option, so I have to wait. Thursday comes around, I go deposit my check into the ATM as requested. I wait my full day as requested. I go to use my card yesterday and now today, and it still doesn't work, my check hasn't cleared. I call them for them to tell me ""Oh, your paycheck threw up a red flag, we're putting a hold on your account. You can't have your money till it clears, you can't have your paycheck back, you're going to be screwed till we decide to let you have it."" and there's nothing I can do about it. Wouldn't even tell me what this ""red flag"" was about, if it's going to happen every paycheck or if it can be fixed. They just ""decide"" to do it and there's nothing you can do about it. Do not, EVER, under any circumstances, go with this bank. They have been nothing but horrible since day 1. Nothing but an inconvenience. Friends don't let friends do business with Bank of America.

The teller comes on the speaker and tells me that he gave my $315 & my ID to the wrong person and they are calling him now to see if he will come back. Shocked, I asked him what would happen if he doesnt. He tells me that they normally do. NORMALLY?!? Is this a common occurance?!? After waiting a while the man arrives with my money and my ID. But this is a mistake that should not happen. The drive through was not busy, maybe 2 or 3 cars there. There were 2 workers. Ive worked at a bank for several years so I get that it can be stressful, but this was blatent incompetency!! The guy who had my money had been gone several minutes before they realized it. I knew Id get my money but I needed my ID. Since its Saturday I would have had to wait till Monday and my job requires me to transport clients. I cant work without my license and would have had to miss 2 days of work. Everything worked out, but it very well may not have. Its the holidays and anyone could have taken that money and ran.

77978885595_10152175300350596	"Dear PetSmart:  My kitten, Luna, and I attended your in-store Halloween event here in Sterling, IL... and did not end up very satisfied in the end. Your online and in-store flyer about the event said to ""bring your PET""... the place looked like a dog-lover's union when we arrived. Now I know that's not on you since you didn't bring in the pets, but when myself and ONE other person are the ONLY ones to tame our kitties for wearing costumes and not going ballistic around a bunch of dogs... I think that's a trick in itself.  We got there just in time for the pet parade and the costume voting... which was completely BIASED!!! Neither cat got much applause because everyone else there loved dogs.. and had extra family members with them to clap louder so they won. Might I suggest a panel of judges next time? Maybe store employees who are off that day? That way, a person who brings their dog and 5 family members to hoot & holler when it's their pet's turn to be clapped for doesn't take the gold because they have more people on their side. That was rediculous.  Also, after the contest there was ""trick or treating"" around the store... All they had was dog treats and my kitten won't eat those. She is a FELINE Greenie's fan! I would think that since you guys didn't specifically say ""bring your dogs"".. and went with ""bring your pets"".. that the event wouldn't be specifically geared towards dogs only. Unless things look better for next year's Halloween in-store contest, I don't think my cat and I will be returning for another round of being dressed up, shaking as I walk her through the parade, and biased voting.

I have to return the wrong one and then reorder the one I ordered originally.  I offered to keep the one I received and pay for the missing piece. They said that they could not just sell me the missing piece.  So now, I have to pay for a new one to be delivered, wait for a refund for the wrong one and hope they send me the right one. In the meantime, I have this monstrosity of a box with the wrong couch sitting in my small apartment and have to wait five days for them to pick it up.   So disappointed in Target."	0	1	0

I asked why I had to pay 89 to sit in a seat that on my itinerary had been assigned to me. Yet when I went to checkin I had been reassigned to 22d which is the almost the last seat on the plane.  So to move back to the original seat area I now need to pay $89.(  Which two days ago you charged me 45.) nice bait  and switch scheme!  I asked how I could have  an assigned seat on my itinerary and yet go to check in and get put in the exact same seat at the back of the plane for outbound and return.  I asked the agent when the change happened and apparently it was yesterday BECAUSE it's summer!  You have lost me as a customer. Your agent told me that she couldn't help in a rude manner and then said to call you since "" she just works here"".   Better yet I have told my company  and hopefully the world that your airline SUCKs!   your not the cheapest when you charge 89 for a seat, (these are not prime seats they are everything from the exit row up to the first class cabin) and 25 dollars for a bag. Your adding 115 dollars each way to to the ticket price.  Sorry, but you have seen the last of this frequent flyer!   "	0	1	0

8103318119_10151291185683120	"Wow.this is the way Target treats loyal customers.  I bought a Dyson Animal Complete for the advertised price on Cyber Monday for $487.49.  I got an email confirmation saying that my order was placed on Monday and is backordered and would be shipped between December 14th -January 2nd.  I am fine receiving the vaccum in a few weeks. Today I got an email today saying that my order was cancelled.  Called Target 3 times because I was disconnected twice after talking to customer service trying to find out why my order was cancelled.  After the third call I got to speak to a supervisor who told me that there is nothing that he could do that it was a computer error on Monday.  I told him that this wasn't my fault and that they should honor the price I bought the vacuum for on Monday.  He basically laughed at me on the phone.  I asked to speak to his suprevisor and he said he didn't have one.  Which I know has to be a lie since I know he isn't the CEO of Target.  The Dyson Animal Complete vacuum is now $649.99 and I can get it at that price...how is that fair?  $200 more than what it was online on Monday at target.com. What Target did is the cyber equivalent of bait and switch and is totally unacceptable.  This same vacuum was offered online at other stores like Bed Bath and Beyond, Home Depot, and even at Dyson.com for the same sales price..but I chose Target because I'm a loyal customer.  I am furious that I have been treated this way by a company.  "	0	1	0

78143372410_10151029485582411	If you are trying to save gas points at Safeway..it is kind of a rip off if you are in Denver.  The Safeway at 26th and Federal keeps their gas prices 3 cents higher than the 7-11 (who has always been a gas price leader) right accross the street from that Safeway.  The two used to run the same price or Safeway was a few cents lower.  They also used to honor 3 cents discount just for being a card member..they took that away.  So if you earn a 10 cent discount..you really only get 7 cents.  What I have figured out is Safeway is higher priced in general on most things and you have to buy in volume to get good deals.  Skip it..go to Bradley gas..you will  pay less in gas and if you go to King Soopers you pay less in groceries.  I think everyone should boycott Safeway until they at least are fair on their gas pricing and competitive because right now they hike their gas price up..let us earn a discount to knock it down a little which makes the price just competitive and no great deal..imput of the day.	0	1	0

As you know if you've been reading all along, Billy Jo is still taking Tamoxifen. It's our ""$300 million megamillions ticket"" - you buy it knowing you likely won't ""win"", but it has no side effects so why not? Well, it's considered a treatment medication and therefore not covered under insurance while in hospice. I filled the prescription 30 days ago at Walgreens and it was $71. I got $34 back by remembering that we have a ""prescription savings card"" through the Kendall County Farm Bureau (we're members in order to have Country Insurance for our homeowners policy). So it was $37 for a 30 day supply.  My sister is a pharmacy tech for Target. Guess what? A 30-day supply of Tamoxifen with no insurance at Target costs $9. Let that sink in - Walgreens: $71. Target: $9. F@$& you Walgreens. I'm done with you. All my meds (even the ones through insurance) are going through Target from now on, insurance or not. Shame on you for marking something up that much that is used to treat women with cancer. ESPECIALLY WHEN YOU DO THIS SH!%.

The representative contacted my branch and was told I used to have a 'Senior' account but they changed the minimum age from 55 to 65 so I no longer have a 'Senior' account. I guess I missed the memo on that one. They were nice enough to reverse the charge and I will definetly be purchasing checks elsewhere next time I need to order. 55.90 seems rather steep."	0	1	0

If your mortgage is due on the first of the month and your payment does not arrive on the first of the month they call and leave a message by the 5th of the month. The message says, ""this is an attempt to collect a debt."" They don't charge for a late payment until the 16th. Customer service at SunTrust just told me the calls will eventually start on the first of the month. Now you can pay your bills on time and still getting collection phone calls.

But the first time I used your Bill Pay system I knew you really didn't love us at all. Actually I thought maybe you were trying to make us go away!! Our Wachovia Bill Pay was sooooo easy and simple. We could pay our bills is record time. It was like the old commercials of the girl that puts in her microwave popcorn and sits down to pay her bills and has it done by the time the popcorn is done. I think the Wells Fargo commercial would havev to feature someone doing a pot roast. Maybe.  Wachovia was the microwave popcorn way. They even trusted us enough to pay our bills without having to do it 5 days in advance. We could actually set the payment on the day it was due!! Granted it has been months  now and I am getting used to it...it would help so much if it wouldn't shut me out from time to time. Sometimes it doesn't let me use the calendar...sometimes it makes me sign in every time I go from one page to the next. Sometimes it is just so messed up that I have to sign in again and start over AND enter all the amounts in again. (So NOT fun!) I have many, many brothers and sisters from our Wachovia family that feel the same way. A lot of us are on the search for something more user friendly as opposed to user hateful. The Wachovia system was just so easy...I think you would have to admit that. Would you please just look at it again...not be prideful and see if you could possibly go that way to save your stepchildren the pain and agony (though it may be worth it) of finding another bank.

A man named Scott Thorson has appeared on the Entertainment Tonight show and blasted untruths about a man that deserves more respect than that. Michael Joseph Jackson had to deal with these same untruths from this same man back in 2004 and now Scott Thorson is at it again...why? Because he wishes to promote his book and to get people to talk about him and get him some attention...he talks bad about Michael Jackson with these unthruts. This has to end and one way that us Michael Jackson fans intend on doing that is to not support a company that sponsors such shows as ET. ET has already given off bad vibes in regard to MJ but this has pulled the last straw for us. Our support of Kraft has come to an end as of right now and will continue to be the case until your support ends for ET. Justice4MJ will be done....one way or another...always!	0	1	0

The site messed up right after I did & I tried to order it again, but it says I don't have enough points (so apparently it did go through the first time?), but it still shows all my points in my account & doesn't show that I ordered anything. Now when I go back to where you order the coupons this is what it tells me this: ""An email containing your digital download information shall be sent shortly after your order is placed. There are no returns allowed for digital download items."" Well how long is it supposed to take before you get this email with to print the coupon?  As of this afternoon, still nothing.  I asked on a coupon blog & was told there would be an option to print in the order status section, but there's nothing.  So according to your site I've spent my points & got nothing.  Now what???"	0	1	0

Thank you!   email 9-30-12 Please note that I love your stores & appreciate the freebies you give out.  I've shopped with you for years!  I've spent literally thousands of dollars in your stores.  That said, I need to complain about one of your cashiers who has twice now given me major attitude when I visit your store to redeem freebie coupons you have supplied me.  Each coupon states one per customer.  When my friend and I go together to both cash in our coupons, she has twice now tried to ring us up together and when we tell her we are going to use separate transactions, the attitude begins.  She won't look at us, scowls during the transaction, and last night she completely ignored me when I asked her a question about my petperks acct being used for my transaction.  She just didn't say a word.  She gave me my total, took my money, and just stood there looking at the floor.  Then my friend gave her their freebies and she said nothing at all.  NOTHING!  He didn't owe any money at the end of the transaction and she just shoved his purchase at him and said NOTHING.  Would not look either of us in the eye!  I felt like a criminal!  And we were doing NOTHING wrong!  My receipt has no name on it but this happened in the 1st register closest to the entrance doors, the cashier was a woman with light brown hair in a pony tail, and the receipt says ""community cashier - 470788.""  The sale number is T-1610 C-101101 1238/101.  I noticed too that it does not show that my petperks account was used and that is the question I asked her that she completely ignored.  I just felt you guys needed to know that you have a cashier that obviously has issue with coupon users working at this store.  I know that I will avoid her lane at all costs from now on, if I even bother to return.  Just don't like being treated like I am doing something wrong when I am not!  I would appreciate a response to my message.  Thank you!"	0	1	0

I get charged $2 plus tax. I look at the receipt and I was charged $1 for each. I ask the cashier she says that I bought the wrong brand and starts ringing up a customer who then walks up as I am showing her the posted sign with the candy's specific name on it. After telling her a second time, she call the manager on duty, never once even looking at the tag. She waited in the empty store and paged the manager a second time that looks at the tag then me and says you have to buy the exact same bar or the computer won't do it. I tell her that isn't what the ad says nor the tag. She gave me a ditry look so I had her return my purchase. Consider this a customer lost."	0	1	0

Here in my small town, in Lufkin, Texas, people have been leaving CVS in droves because of the pharmacy mistakes, the wait time for Rx, etc.  Now, they have a wanna-be security guard who has cost my precious daughter-in-law so much heartache and grief, she is struggling to cope emotionally.  Not only that, she and my son had to hire an expensive lawyer to fight a charge that she was stealing a pair of cheap reading glasses.  She was looking through them in the mirror when some of her students walked up to her to say, ""Hi.""  She put the glasses up on top of her head, with the tag dangling...not even trying to hide them.  She has to use reading glasses, and her habit is to do that.  So, without thinking, she was talking to the kids and beginning to walk to the exit.  The security guard grabbed her, in front of the students, and basically terrorized her. It was a traumatic experience for all.  Not only that, but they have received a threatening letter from CVS. My son turned it over to the lawyer.  They demanded their $15 pair of glasses back or else pay $250.  The glasses were confiscated as evidence!  CVS already has them!  My daughter would not steal a complimentary bar of soap from a hotel, much less something from a store.  She is just absent minded, but as honest as is the day is long. My son tried to talk to CVS management there.  They were rude and unyielding, telling him to get a good lawyer.  So he did.  Now the video tapes have been subpoenaed, and all of this is going to cost them at least $2000.  They live paycheck to paycheck.  It will be more if it goes to trial.  The odd thing is that the security guard grabbed my daughter-in-law before she had even gotten out the door.  Such a nightmare.  This is no way to treat a good customer.  I know stores have to protect their merchandise, but they also need to have security guards with common sense. A policeman friend of ours says that many of the security guards in stores have a terrible macho ego problem, and this is the way they get to display it.  So terrible.  "	0	1	0

56805881344_10150791904406345	"Instant Expert...Bakin' Bacon  Since I have lard on my mind, I will render mine from bacon, and have bacon for the prize.   Begin with a rimmed baking sheet covered with foil.  Place a pound or so of bacon on the foil in a single layer.  Place the pan in the oven and turn the oven on to 400 degrees F. (Yes, a cold oven...and this is the only time ever ever ever that I will tell you to start with a cold oven)  Set your timer for 15 minutes and check the bacon. Depending upon the thickness, it might be done. If not, it will be close, so keep you eye on it from this point on. When the bacon is done to your satisfaction, remove the pan from the oven and remove the bacon to paper towel to cool. Allow the renderings to cool slightly and pour through cheesecloth. Store the rendering/lard in the refrigerator or freezer. Use the lard to create the most incredible biscuits, the most delicate pie crusts and the most delicious vegetables you have ever tasted, just like grandma used to make...And by the way, the renderings will not taste as much like bacon as you might imagine.   If you are bakin' your bacon in your BlueStar oven, you can easily tell when you are close to done. Your bakin' bacon is high visible because your BlueStar has dual halogen oven lights, and an easy view oven door window system. Lucky you!  Food for thought,  Karen"	0	1	0

I purchase their fruit cups, and canned fruit on a regular basis. I just purchased their new apple fruit crisp. I was opening the box that held the two bowls together and just happened to catch APPLES FROM CHINA stamped on the bottom of the carton! Now I know we import more food than ever before, BUT REALLY....APPLES FROM CHINA????? Give me break. I called their customer service department, only to get an arrogant man that talked down to me. I guess it was my southern accent....he read me facts and stats.....told me his company was right in their decision to import products from China. What he did do was make me angry enough to go viral. His holier than thou attitude did not make me happy either! So the next time you buy a Dole product make sure you read the entire label BEFORE you purchase! Better still, boycott all DOYLE products! My favorite orange juice, Tropicana, just stopped importing oranges from Brazil because of traces of some substance that was poison. SO only GOD knows what is in these apples.

I listened to pharmacists belittle customers asking for help.  I watched the store manager try to bang some 16 year old.  I listened to them explain to customers that they didn't have stock.  I'm used to crappy service.  Your pharmacy is by far the worst i've ever been to.  Rite Aid is better. Walgreens is better. Local grocery stores are better.  You are not better than any pharmacy that has or ever will exist.  Your systems are horrible. Your people are angry and bitter and full of self loathing.

Well America is a free country .. or at least it was.  As a American Corporation it is your choice to back who you want.  As it is MY choice to drop you from my home/kitchen and every where in between. There are more of us than their are of them so I suggest you re-think your position on this matter.  Until then I will NOT be buying anything made by your company or your subsidiaries.  I will also tell all my friends not to buy Kraft products.   My only question is this... Why are you siding with people who want to destroy this great nation?  Why is it you think showing your ID to vote is a bad thing ?  Are you excited to have 200 years of voting and everyone having an equal chance destroyed ?  Apparently so... their is NO other reason to keep people from showing their ID other than to FIX or have illegal's voting in order to push forth the Socialist policies we are fighting against.   So... while one person refusing to buy your products might not worry you.. trust me we are strong and mighty and for every one who writes you, there are 10 more who don't and are boycotting you also.

So, I'm really upset that I've been having such bad experiences with your site lately.  Today, I shopped online and when I went to checkout, every time I hit the checkout button, it would simply refresh the page and would not take me to the log in page.  So, I called to place the order over the phone.  She took my info, I gave her all the item numbers and she started processing my order.  I was surprised when she stated there was a $13.99 shipping charge on the order, because when I searched for the products, I specifically filtered by items that were free ship eligible.  She looked into it & 2 items were free ship eligible, but she said the other one was not.  She stated that item 11872934 was not eligible.  When I go to your kids' bedding tab and filter by ""free ship eligible"" this set comes up.  After I pointed it out to her and she confirmed that it was indeed wrong, she said I would still have to pay shipping and she couldn't take it off.  Really?  If your site shows something as free ship eligible in error, you should honor it.  So, I spent 15 minutes on the phone and got nowhere.  This is very upsetting.  Especially on the heels of Target losing one of my 14 item orders and simply returning all the items back to my credit card.  You can do better than this!"	0	1	0

167890209688_10151012550039689	"SUNTRUST: HORRIBLE ONLINE BANKING!!!   We just spent 2.5 hours bouncing around various escalations in the online banking department (877 884 4480 ext. 61054 and 61096) to get a simple electronic (CSV) export of business account over the last 3 years. This by the way has been something I have been able to do in under a minute with pretty much everyone else I bank with. For many years now.  Do you know that the Suntrust branches actually told me they still store their documents on Microfiche! It would cost $300 to pull it off and hand print 3 years of statements. Just wow. Welcome to the year 1941.   I have a background in the electronic banking industry, and this is a VERY SIMPLE request if they just would put me through to a database admin. They literally said they would not because they can't do it for everyone.   Just the most pathetic thing I have ever heard. The fact that you can export only 60 days of data via the website is also pathetic. The Suntrust online bank website is by far the worst of any of the banks I use. Inflexible, terrible usability, slow, and broken a good amount of the time. I can't access bill pay at this very moment! I really only keep them because they have a branch close to me.  I think this is the last straw tho.. I am taking my business elsewhere. Suntrust should be ashamed of themselves. Truly worthless.  PS: SunTrust if you actually care about my business and *YOUR* business for that matter, you are welcome to contact me via FB. But I want someone executive level. Probably either the office of CMO Rilla Delonier (the Live Solid, Bank Solid lady (how ironic is that?) or CIO Anil Chriyan.. I am tired of talking to your useless customer ""service"".  I will be glad to give you a log on to a small credit union I use whose website literally blows yours away. Perhaps you can buy them and use their technology.

12699262021_10150772365272022	"In January, I received (I believe through e-mail) a coupon for a free Rocketfish Stylus. On Tuesday, I took my coupon to the Best Buy in Eden Prairie, MN. and was planning on using it when I bought a new battery for my camera. When I got to the register, the cashier scanned the coupon and it said ""activating phone card"" and then ""this phone card has already been activated"". Both myself and the cashier were confused because obviously the coupon was for the Stylus so she tried it again, and got the same message. She then proceeded to call over her Manager. This man was so rude to me. He insinuated that I had a fake coupon (when it CLEARLY said on the top of my print out bestbuy.com etc.) and was like ""You already used the coupon so..."" I stated that the coupon doesn't even SCAN as a coupon for the Stylus...it says something about a phone card. The cashier also said she thought she had heard something about this coupon scanning incorrectly but could not recall exactly. His response was to just walk away. It does not surprise me that a company that has had TONS of bad press lately employs such a%$$hole people in its stores. That was the LAST TIME I will shop at Best Buy. I'll take my business elsewhere....where there are better prices and better CUSTOMER SERVICE. "	0	1	0

My kids have been excited for weeks to surprise their dad with something that he always dreamed of for Christmas. Well... a package arrived last night, my husband went to get it, only to find out that it had a big hole and he saw what it was. He was nice enough to let us know that he saw it, so we had no choice but let him enjoy it since yesterday. So now this whole ""Surprise"" that the kids were planning is over. You would think that Best Buy would cover it with another box especially this time a year, instead of with a plastic that can easily be ripped off. Walmart does it, Target does it, how come Best Buy can't? Now it is over, and I am just very irritated with this situation.  A very dissapointed customer."	0	1	0

313163945066_10151044540370067	"So I've been a customer at U.S. Bank for almost 10 years.  Other than a few minor hiccups along the way I've had no issues with them until today.  This week I opened a new account for Balance Lighting Systems.  Deposited some checks and started.. wait for it... using my account... oh the humanity right?  Historically, when I make a deposit with USBank, the funds are available within 24 hours.  Something I've always loved about the bank.  Well, Mr. Rep failed to inform me that for the first 30 days of a new account, regardless of previous banking history, they have to wait for the funds to complete the clearing process (a 5 day process) before funds become available.  This means that even if the bank the deposited check is drawn on confirms that there are available funds... the physical transaction has to complete before I gain access to the full balance.  Since I wasn't told this, I spent money, money that won't be available to me till after the holiday, so, I'll probably end up with a few rubber checks on my brand new business account that I was so proud of.   If I would have known that, I would have opened the acct with 50 dollars cash, then deposited the checks in my personal account, then transfered the funds on-line.  Ya know, the wrong way... which seems to be the only way to get things done anymore.  "	0	1	0

Enjoy the pictures I took at your CVS in Maricopa Arizona today. Store number 568-8291. You have two pharmacy employees on. As you can see, the drive thru window closed without even a note on it saying to come inside. Then going up front 20 people deep waiting to check out with one cashier. Finally at 3pm two more cashiers come in to help out front. I walked into this CVS at 2:08pm and you can see my receipt reads 3:00pm. It was actually 3:04pm.  I don't know how many more calls, emails, posts on facebook I need to make before you all realize this store has gone to hell. This store is less than 1 mile from my house. I'm ready to transfer all of my prescriptions to somewhere else. I am disgusted that Ray the Pharmacy manager has still not called me and Mariam or whatever the correct way to say her name is, has told me over and over this store (pharmacy) is getting help. You have an employee who is ready to walk out the door and I don't blame them.  Again, yet again, my email is mitomommy@gmail.com and have been going to this cvs for 5 years now. My daughter takes 13 meds. This is not acceptable in any way shape or form for the pharmacy or the front of the store!!!!"	0	1	0

I was still refused and told that they are not allowed to reduce the coupon amount because they wont get reimbursed for it. The Manager was not in and I was told he will be out until tuesday so I cant follow up with him until AFTER the sale is over.  What exactly is the cashier supposed to do when this situation arises?

ATTENTION CUSTOMERS:  The store at 1906 Kings Highway, Port Charlotte, Florida does not accept pennies in a quantity that would make their cashier actually do her job.  I have never been so humiliated in all of my life.  The cashier was plain rude to the woman in front of me.  I took my turn, asked her how her day was, and when I put the 4 rolls of pennies on the counter to pay for the cup cake papers and the #7 birthday candle for my daughter's cake.   cashier: ""I have to unwrap those and count them""   Me:  ""um... ok, I'm sorry it's all I have."" cashier: ""I don't think we can take these.  I'll have to ask my manager."" Me: ""okay"" She storms off in a huff and comes back madder than before. Me: ""I'm really sorry, it really is all I have"" cashier:  Couldn't you have taken it to the bank?"" (that really never occurred to me, really?  It's a couple of bucks.  I counted to 200 to put them in the wrappers, surely she can count them individually in whatever quantity works best for her ability. cashier:  ""Do you have 14 cents?""  I pulled ten cents out of my pocket, and told her I had to run to the van for the other 4 cents.  I had absolutely no problem doing that at all.  By the time I came back in, I was fuming and she was still rude.  The manager's excuse was that she had to count the pennies.  I'm sorry, since when is currency unacceptable in this store, in whatever denomination or amount the customer brings in?  Before I left, I was yelling at the cashier, I apologized to the customers who were behind me.  Funny, how I got to apologize for being humiliated.    I will NEVER go back in that store or any other store that you have.   If I had the extra money to spend the gas to go to the bank to change the pennies into cash .... I still wouldn't do it.  Your employees are working a retail position.  In that position, one must be able to count change.  It's just the way it is.    IF I didn't need these items, I would have gotten my money back, but I have a beauty who is turning 7 on Sunday, and I think counting 2.14 worth of pennies is what has to happen for me to make her day as best as  possible.  Oh, please give the manager my phone number.  I will message it to you.  Should one of those rolls come up short on pennies, I will get paid next Wednesday and have to be in that area.  I will be more than happy to drop off whatever it could possibly be.  Though it was counted twice by myself and once by my husband before we rolled them.  Sincerely,   Tracy Roelle "	0	1	0

My story starts with a Christmas gift that my out of state relative got me. She got me a bathroom set, but I wanted to get different colors. So I go to return them to get a merchandise credit so I can pick out new colors. No... it has become a corprate refund. Not over $100 dollars, not a huge amount, I've seen it done for more before. Haven't returned something there in years, so I couldn't have reached my ""limit"". I wait weeks, the holidays pass, finally I call the number on the receipt, a process I can now do backwards, sleeping, while playing piano. I have the phone number and 12 digit reciept code memorized. Finally after waiting for 30 minutes listening to clips of old pop songs for the second time today, I finally got a person. (I've done this three times a week since the new year)  Basically to make this novel shorter, the person resolved my problems, but why should it have taken me so long to get a human who was able to solve my problem in a half an hour.

So the entire hour that I was gone, no one could get the ""thing"" off, and no one thought to call me to tell me to come get my car back??????????  Confused, I asked for a manager who was just as confused as to what was going on. He then tells me to hold on, and then comes back to tell me that he got the cap off and it will be ready in 10 minutes.

You refuse to provide email transcripts, for illegal charges! Then you wonder why people want bank statements. This is the last straw after the $9 teller fee and the $25 savings account fee, because YOU sold our mortgage to Green Tree, who wants $12 if we pay it through them. While all this is going on, you are collecting bonuses and I'm clipping coupons! Once, I dig through online statements to find what I need (which you used to do), we will be completely disconnected from you, except for how we bailed you out when you needed us. How ironic!"	0	1	0

When dis-satisfied with their size in my living room, I found myself unable to return my $200 purchase. Its seems when using paypal to purchase through Target online, you may only return for an ""in-store credit"". Are you kidding me!? I cannot think of the last time I spent 200 at target. And this was right after Christmas, and I did not have $200 to donate to Target. I think that you had kidnapped my money, and should be ashamed of this system. I realize now that there was another credit card payment system, but I did not see it then. I have a college education. I am not dumb. I am an RN/single mother. I do the right thing everyday! And its surprises me to say the least that you would allow such an action to be done to your customers. I did come in and spend the card on the grocery that were available in store. We are in a recession. And it takes some of us some time to save 200 for furniture. In any case this is a morally wrong thing to do. And it certainly seems like something more like what walmart would do (whom I consider to be morally corrupt). Please don't allow this hijacking to continue. Change the rules or discontinue the paypal system. When I see that you have made any changes, I will consider Target for major purchases again."	0	1	0

Yesterday, I went to my local PetSmart to purchase a bag of Nature's Recipe.  I had a coupon from Nature's Recipe, printed from their website.  I was told that they will no longer accept coupons that are printed at home.

147285781446_10151136177236447	"OK for you gun control advocates, let's get this straight. The term ""Assault Weapon"" does not only apply to military style weapons, such as the AK47 or the AR15. Let's look at the definitions...Assault: a violent physical attack; Weapon: something (as a club, knife, or gun) used to injure, defeat, or destroy. So when the words are used together, ""anything"" used in a violent physical attack upon someone, is an ""Assault Weapon"" by definition. A BIC pen, if used to assault someone, is an assault weapon. Don't laugh. A BIC pen in the hands of a well trained individual is indeed a deadly weapon! Your arguement that no one needs an assault weapon because they're not good for hunting or sport shooting is BS. Your claims that they're only good for killing lots of people by shooting high capacity clips is BS. FACT 1: All AR10, AR15 and AK47 style weapons make very good hunting weapons. Many manufacturers make ""hunting legal"" clips for these weapons. Hunting legal clips are defined in most states as a clip that holds no more than 4 rounds + 1 round in the chamber for a maximum of 5 rounds. They work very well on a large variety of game animals and nuisance animals. FACT 2: All AR10, AR15 and AK47 style weapons make very good sport shooting weapons. I won't go into all the various events and range set ups where people enjoy shooting these style weapons. I will give you one huge event that is growing by leaps and bounds yearly, the ""3 Gun Challange."" The 3 Gun Challenge involves pistols, shotguns and rifles. The rifles of choice are predominantly the AR10, the AR15 and the AK47. And one other thing...These style weapons employ thousands of people nationwide in manufacturing and retail jobs. To ban them simply based upon your illogical, pathetic beliefs, would cost thousands of jobs for no worthy reason at all!"	0	1	0

She even had her receipt to show she bought the extra warranty!  And they had no recommendations for cleaning it. Basically we were told that she now has a $1800 piece of trash. *sarcastic font* Thanks for the excellent service, Best Buy. *end sarcastic font* I will never buy anything from Best Buy again."	0	1	0

After contacting them about it, they just say they are sorry this is happening but they can't give us the correct coupon. Then they say they will give us another $5 off a shipping purchase or if we charge something, $5 off that. To me that is not good enough!

So I don't know how much good this will do but I will tell you my story...  I went to the store for the first time ever and made a purchase.  The items I purchased were on sale at 25% off.  I went to the register to pay and the boy who was checking me out asked me if I wanted to apply for a credit card.  I said NO.  I don't do credit cards...learned my lesson a long time ago.  He continued to ask me.  I continued to say no, further explaining that I was unemployed had come in planning to pay cash.  He would not stop pestering me and said that I would recieve an additional 15% off.  Because he was not taking no for an answer I said.  Do I have to use the credit card to get the additional discount?  He said no.  I said do I have to be approved to get the additional discount?  He said no.  So because the line was forming behind me and he was not taking no for an answer I figured fine, I' ll take your damn discount just let me out of here.  In fact I was about to say never mind to the whole purchase because he was so pushy. I filled out the credit application and said ok give me my discount.  Ok so what do I owe you.  He told me the total and asked how I wanted to pay.  At this point I had become very irritated.  I told him that I had already said I was going to pay cash because I have the money in my hand and had no desire to have a credit card bill come in the mail a month from now when I may not have the money.  I reminded him that I don't do credit cards and that is why i didn't want to apply in the first place.  He told me my total and I handed him the cash for more than the total he told me.  He gave me change and finally I left.  Let me say that at this point my first and only experience at Kohl's was not so great.  A pushy punk and the register who annoyed me and had a line of irritated people because he wouldn't just check me out after I repeatedly said no thanks to the credit card.  Several months later I started getting phone calls from a number I did not recognize.  The calls were coming in the middle of the night!!! as well as all hours of the day.  Finally I answered to see who in the world was calling me and  the message actually said...""Please put in your social security number"".  Of course I hung up.  The phone calls continued and each time I answered it said put in your social.  no identification of who it was that was calling me or anything just, put in your social.  Finally instead of hanging up I pushed buttons to see if it would take me somewhere or to someone as I was convinced it was a scam fishing for my personal information and I intended to gather info to report it to the police etc.   I was shocked when I finally got a person and asked who is this.  The person would not tell me!!!!!!!!  They wanted my info who are you.  I finally told here I am not telling you anything you need to stop  calling etc.  Finally she told me it was Kohl's and I told her that I wasn't sure that I believed her because of the nature of the calls etc.  I asked some questions and asked for a different phone number that was not so sketchy after much discussion she gave me one.  So second impression of Kohl's very bad, I mean what ligit business calls people in the middle of the night and does not ID themselves and asks for the social.  And why did she not want to tell me who she was....  At any rate I called the number she provided me and it did id it as being Kohl's.  So finally I said why am I getting these calls?  And at that time....SEVERAL MONTHS later I am told that I have a balance on my credit card.  How can this be?  I paid cash.  I paid the amount the fellow at the register asked for.  There is no way I have a credit card balance.  She proceeds to tell me that my balance is some large amount because of the late fees and interest (which is the reason company's want you to charge in the first place and exactly the reason I don't use credit cards).  I asked what was the original amount without all the nonsense.  $7.00 bucks!    I again explained that I had never charged anything.  That I had only applied because of the obnoxious pressure of the clerk and the 15% discount but had paid in cash the full amount.  After explaining this and she continuing to tell me that in that case she would be glad to remove the excess charges and just collect the $7.  I asked if she really thought this was good customer service in light of the fact that I did not owe anything because I had never charged anything.  The one and only purchase I have ever made at Kohl's was paid in full with cash on the day of the purchase.  I guess she thought it was but i disagreed and said well this is indeed a scam so your clerk harrasses people to the point of either walking out or signing up, then he fraudulently puts a charge on your card and you crazy people harass via phone calls in the middle of the night fishing for personal info and because its only $7.00 you figure I will pay something I don't owe just to get you off my back...after a couple of hundred customers get ripped off in this manner you've made a pretty good amount of money and no one is the wiser becasue it was just $7.  I AM NOT GOING TO PAY ANYTHING I DO NOT OWE AND I DO NOT OWE KOHL'S ANYTHING!  I talked to this girls supervisor and explained the same thing over and over.  She told me to contact the store manager and he would fix it and remove it from the card at the store level.  I called the store manager and explained.  He appologized and said of course he would take care of it.  He supposedly could not take care of it at the store unlike the customer dis-service rep/sup had told me so again supposedly he called them to handle it.  He later called me back and said no problem I got it taken care of for you but you will have to call this number and talk to so and so.  Ok.  At this point feeling relief, I eagerly call the number he told me to call and got hold of the person he told me to talk to and was told that the store manager was wrong and that the only thing that could be done was for me to pay the $7.  She was rude and insulting.  She told me that no was were they going to remove it and she argued that I did not pay the correct amount on the day of my purchase and the remaining difference was $7.  I further told her I don't care how or why the totals didn't match up because I paid the amount that I was told to pay and if it was indeed supposed to be something else it wasn't/isn't my problem its Kohl's!  I freaking paid what I was told to pay and I paid it in cash, of course I don't have the receipt because it was months ago and it was a cash payment the items fit and I wore them many time over, I had no need of such receipt.  Again she said I would have to pay. Again I said nope I will not.  I don't owe it.  Finally I hung up and called the store manager back.  He did not answer his phone.  I left a message he did not return my call.  Several messages later he still did not/ has not returned my call.  So that tells me he knew he was lying to me.  I am so sick of this shit!  So here's where we are.  I get 10 to 20 yes really!  10 to 20 phone calls a day from Kohl's.  I have spoken with multiple customer dis-service agents, I have argued with several agents and so on.  I have done what I was told to do and  have been treated rudely and been lied to.  Kohl's made a terrible first impression with basically forcing a damn credit card that I did not want down my throat.  Someone, somewhere, somehow put a charge on my card that should not be there. That is fraud!  FRAUD! and it continues to shine a bad light on Kohl's that no one will help me the customer with that problem, which means your are the one's running the SCAM.  You have made sure that I will NEVER SHOP AT KOHL'S......EVER!  There are too many stores out there to need or want to ever come in your store again.  I will NEVER HAVE A GOOD THING TO SAY ABOUT KOHL'S  in fact I go out of my way to tell all of my friends that you suck and why.  It's called word of mouth advertising and you will never get good advertising from me....EVER!  I am sure that the $7 you are trying to scam from me would not even be a drop in the bucket toward the actual money you have spent in trying to collect it.  Let alone the money you might have made from a happy satisfied customer...poor economics!  So you can fix it as it should have never happened in the first place or you can keep calling and I will keep posting negative publicity for you for every phone call I get.And if I keep getting calls and collection notices and bad credit scores because of your crap, I will continue to seek other avenues to expose you.  Bottom line is simple.  I DO NOT OWE YOU ANYTHING AND I WILL NOT UNDER ANY CIRCUMSTANCES PAY YOU ANYTHING! not $7 not late fees, not interest NOTHING!!!!!! "	0	1	0

The home had a purchaser who backed out after BOA appraised the home and approved a $100,000 sale price.

7003656077_10151014406106078	Update. After 3hours on hold I got to speak to a staff personnel to try yo figure out the plan. Our plane landed here but the lady said it will depart today but they over booked it and we can't get on. I asked how they could do this conside ring we paid and were waiting in the airport at 2am until 6am to beat the lines and be available to fly. No AA staff was available at airport and they sent us back to our hotel. The lady on the phone I spoke to Her reply is the flight was booked for new passengers. I asked if their policy is to strand passengers. Her reply was yes. I had to ask her this twice to ensure she heard me correctly when asked if their policy is to strand passengers. Again she stated yes. She then proceeded to tell me this Saturday is the best they can for us. So I asking to speak to a manager. Got put on hold again for 40minutes. A nice lady picked up. I asked if she is a manager. She replied no. She said her co worker handed the call off to her and said you deal with this call. The new lady was gracious enough to work with me to contact their competitors to arrange a flight. Unfortunately the competitors have openings but want to reserve the seats for their own passengers. I explained to the kind lady that our flight we paid for here was first-class we paid for and they flew us coach and they missed our departing flight flying in to Trinidad. So we had to pay for a night in Miami at our expenses and we were paying for a hotel in Trinidad for the same night that we were not using. Now on our departing flight home AA has canceled us again. This kind lady was appalled at the lack of help and service we were giving by AA that she will do everything she can to make something happen. Everyone we have spoken to from AA said to bad and not their problem we just have to deal with it. The kind lady told me she will call us back in a day to let me know what she can do. After 15min she called me back and offered me this. Hello I just wanted to make you aware Today go to airport to see if Miami airport will open. We are attempting to try a stand by. The problem is only a few flights fly out of Trinidad. All flights are booked. There is a slim chance we can get out to Miami and we will stay in Miami for a night at our expenses then they may be able to get us on a flight to Dallas on Tuesday afternoon. Then from Dallas to Chicago by Tuesday night. Now this is all preliminary at this stage. I could not be thank ful enough to this very kind lady that did everything she could to help us after all other AA staff dropped the ball and customer service. I told her get me back to the state's and we can take it from their. I'm putting this out their to show that this Very gracious AA staff took it upon her self to continue to assist us at what ever she could do despite that her co workers said it's not going to happen and just wait until this next Saturday. She said thats not acceptable. I thanked her from the bottom of my heart. Now we Will find out at 3pm today if we get to Madison. I say it's a start and we will try our best. I'll keep you posted	1	0	0

12699262021_10151274969252022	"Hey Best Buy. I'm not sure if the post I tried to make earlier went through. I'm really frustrated with your company. It seems like every time I give you another chance, you fail me.  Today I realized that I needed an Apple Lightning Bolt to 30 pin adapter for my upcoming trip. I really dislike going to the mall and didn't want to have the item shipped since I need it by tomorrow. Geographically speaking, Best Buy was the best option with my limited time frame. I checked on your website first to see if you even carried the item, which it says that you do. Next, I made sure to check that it was available for in store pick up, it was. So I placed my order. About 20 minutes later I received an email saying that my item had been picked and was ready for me to pick up. I drove down to my local Best Buy and went to the in store pick up counter where they were unable to find my item. The woman working the counter went to the back and then went into the floor to try to find the item.  After about 15 minutes I was offered the excuse that my item was ""on hold for black Friday"". This seems odd because it is just a small adapter and Apple likely wouldn't discount them. Hey, who knows? But to me, the paying customer who drove down there, I didn't find it to be an adequate excuse. After all, someone had picked the item and generated my email, right? Naturally I asked to speak with a manager who should be in the know, right? He consulted with the girl at the pick up desk and then disappeared for another 15 minutes. I was unaware of his course of action so I asked the girl if I should assume he is looking for the product to which she replied, yes. The manager came back after those 15 minutes and was empty handed. They were forced to refund my money. Oh, by the way I got an email stating that I had picked my order up. Needless to say, I am very frustrated. While this isn't the end of the world, I now understand why many folks refer to your establishment as ""Amazon's Showroom"". I really think that A) you need to update your online ordering/store pick up system. B) Fire or train or do something with the employee who incorrectly picked my order prompting me to visit your store under false pretenses.  C) Train managers a little bit in communication and customer relations. I don't like being told different things. If it was held for black Friday, fine, just go grab me one. But if they're nowhere to be found at the same time, then there is a problem. At least one person in that store should have known where the item I ordered was if that product was on hold for Friday. The clerk told me your inventory reflected 30 in stock. But rather than make it right for the customer, they decided to give up and refund me and send me on my way. I was pretty patient and polite. I didn't even use a swear word! I didn't raise my voice either. So now I have to go to the mall, which I really dislike. "	0	1	0

After one of my many phone calls, the account rep told me that my request for checks was in the system and I should see them in a few days. Nothing. During another call, I was then instructed to request access to my open account. This required a credit check, along with the hit to my credit rating. I received a denial letter days later. I was denied the ability to use my account.that was still open and good standing. Due to my near 800 credit score, I called Bank of America again for information.

Very short flight in a very small plane. I checked in my bag along with my assistants bag at the same time.

I was told that my bag didn't make it because of the short time between check-in and departure, however, and leaving me perplexed, that explanation was not good enough because my assistants bag did arrive on our flight.

I have overdraft protection set up on my account. Over the weekend, there was a pending charge on my account that I did not authorize that caused my account to be short .83. Then I got charged 12.50 for you to transfer the .83. Usually I am very thankful for my OVD protection, but had the charge never been there, I wouldn't have been charged. I called with no help from customer services. So I was going to suck it up and pay the fee. Checked online banking today to know how much I needed to deposit today, and to my surprise my account was negative again!!! Wth.... I looked and a dollar transaction cleared that got me yet another 12.50 charge. And now I don't have enough money in my other account to cover a check I wrote for my daughters school because of this. None of this would have happened had that stupid pending charge not been there, and how lucky that it dropped of so now I can't dispute this. I was left with a mess and all customer services tells me is I wanted the service ( OVD protection ) and they used it so I have to pay the fee. Now I have to worry about an overextended OVD fee hitting my account tomorrow, even though my husband will get his check direct deposited , because tomorrow will be day 7, but now I have to worry about my daughters lunch money check being returned and me getting a 36 fee for that and from the school. I am so ashamed to say I was an employee there and understand why clients came in cussing me. The sad thing is, if I didn't have OVD protection, with all charges being under 5 dollars, I never would have got any fees and my account would have a positive balance today. But now because of this wonderful service I am looking at possibly almost 100 in fees and I have 4 small children. That you SunTrust for screwing over families.

At which point I told the cashier that as I understood the coupon, I only had to purchase one of the items listed and not all.  To which she reply ?I'm the one that speaks English here not you? in a very unprofessional and mocking manner.  I told her that she was correct that I didn't speak English that well but I did know how to read and that was not a way to treat someone. Once I asked for a manager she said that she in fact is one of the managers in the same tone of voice as before.   This goes against all of Wal-Mart's Statements of Ethics and demand that action be taken to further train this individual in the correct way to approach a customer with certain disabilities such as my own.

Most of my Christmas shopping was done this year at Target.com and, for the first time, I didn't receive part of my order.

I told her that we had had issues with our USPS delivery woman in the past and, despite what the tracking said, I didn't have my order. She informed me that my money would be refunded and I told her that I didn't want a refund, I wanted my product (which is why I ordered it in the first place). She told me that Target did not do replacements and that I would have to reorder, which I thought was strange. When I got off the phone with her, I checked your website for the product that I had ordered. It had more than doubled in price. It makes me wonder if this was the reason that I wasn't sent a replacement for the first item that was ordered and  not delivered to my address. This is NOT a money issue, as my item was only $7.99 and wasn't a necessary, just a want. I just don't understand not caring about your loyal customers. I want the product that I ordered, at the price that I ordered it; I do NOT want a refund and then have to pay double because a shipment was not delivered.

Payments made up to the minimum payment will be applied to the balance with the lowest Annual Percentage Rate (APR) first.

Our goal is to deliver prompt, accurate and courteous service to our customers, Sarah. We regret that the outcome of this matter has not met your approval.   Sincerely,   Kala E.  Service Advisor   The payment that I made to my account was not a minimum payment.  I paid the entire balance on my account minus the exact amount drafted on the ""0%"" check.

179590995428478_438274166226825	"BofA is the worst company to have credit card balances with. You make it so difficult to pay simple bills. My biggest issue is that I can not pay my credit card bills with BofA from my Android phone. The BofA App only lets you pay your credit card bills by transferring money from your BofA bank account to your credit card. I don't bank with BofA. When I log into my online account on my cell phone - through the web, it won't allow me to pay there either because I do not have an eligible account to pay from. (I am able to pay from a non-mobile computer by logging into the same online account.) All of this is done to make it more difficult for people to pay their bills with you - increasing the chances that someone will either miss a payment or make a late payment. Making it more likely and possible for BofA to charge late fees, increase interest rates, and ruin your credit. Even online it is not user friendly. ALL other credit card websites allow you to click a button to select Minimum Payment, Statement Balance, etc. Not BofA....you have to type in the amount you want to pay. So, due to a typo made by me, I paid $2 less than the minimum payment and BofA lowered my credit limit (which affected my credit score), charged late fees, and raised my interest rate. Sneaky slimy little tricks that other banks/credit card companies don't resort to. And BofA wonders why they have billions of dollars in ""settlements."" "	0	1	0

117497138610_10151177461388611	"Walgreens is all about ripping you off.  Went and got some prescriptions filled tonight and only went there because my son was too sick to travel further.  Well, if you have a prescription that costs less than your insurance companies minimum, they charge you that.  One prescription we can get at Walmart or Target for $4 ... Walgreens $10.  Here's the big kicker.  Asthma medicine shows on our insurance as costing a co-pay of $40, Walgreens charges $60.  So we overpaid by $26 tonight and if you take the $26 x 12 months supply (if we would go to Walgreens every month), that is $312 a year in overcharges!  I argued with them but they wouldn't back down and my kid is struggling to breathe so we had to get the prescription.  Walgreens needs to change their motto to ""committed to ripping you off""."	0	1	0

It states that Nivea for Men will be on sale 2/$7 with a $2.00 Register Reward, excluding Q10 Lotion and Eye Rollers.  When I went to my local Walgreens today, there was only one Nivea for Men product marked with the sale price.  No big deal, because the deals are often not marked.  I pick up two of the Nivea for Men Revitalizing Face Scrub and take it to the register to do a price check.  It scans for full price.  I question the cashier, and he agrees that it should be on sale.  He talks with another employee (assistant manager, maybe?) and she also agrees that it should qualify because of the wording in the ad.  However, they both went down the aisle while I stayed at the register with my kids, and when they came back, they told me that it wasn't part of the promotion.  I asked why, since according to the ad, it should be.  They couldn't give me an answer - just ""We don't know, but it's not included""."	0	1	0

Daddy set up the tank first thing Christmas morning.  We were told by employees at you store that it needed to be set up for 4 days before purchasing fish.  We went Saturday morning.  I made sure to tell the employee in the fish department that we needed fish easy for beginners to take care of.  On their advice we got 4 tetras, 2 glow fish, and 2 albino catfish.  Upon bringing them home we found out that one of the tetra's was completely missing it's fantail.  It could not swim well at all, and kept getting trapped in the filter, so we had to bring it back, and get a replacement.  The very next morning the replacement was dead.  I brought it back, and decided to get another glow fish instead.  The employee in the fish department said it had probably been sick from the get go.  Also, for the first time the girl squirted something in the bag with the new glow fish.  I asked her what it was and she said it was a water cleaner that should have been used everytime we got a fish.  She also said we should have been told to get this for our own tank, and was suprised that no one had mentioned it.  Well, this morning yet another tetra died.  These fish were marked down to a $1 each (normally $2.19), and I am beginning to think it is because the store knows their is a sickness or contamination issue, and is trying to get rid of them.  It would have cost more then a $1 to drive back and forth to the store AGAIN, for the THIRD time, so my husband chose to flush this one.  I would like to know what can be done to make up for several trips back and forth, the gas involved, and 2 upset kids.  Our tank is not the issue either, because the glow fish, and catfish are doing just fine.  I would hate to stop shopping at Petsmart, as we also have 2 dogs, but I will have to find somewhere else that fits our needs, if this problem is not satisfactorily taken care of. "	0	1	0

Just had an experience that made me vow never to shop at Target again... purchased items in women's lingerie (OK, I bought UNDERWEAR) and got home realized I'd bought the wrong size.  Went in a week later (we don't live close) and returned them.  When I got the refund I found that instead of refunding the $5 purchase price (they were absolutely in purchase condition, tags etc. receipt with me... never left the bag) I had been refunded $4.  There was no sign on the shelf saying anything, as far as I knew the items were $5 regular price... the cashier didn't say anything but here you go to take them back and the young man at the customer service desk points at the receipt which lists a promotional sale price of $5 and a 'refund price' of $4.  Sure 'nuf... said it right there in black and white.  I had watched the cashier ring things up, grabbed the receipt, shoved it in the bag and never looked at it.  Never heard of such a thing so I never expected it... I couldn't argue with black and white.  You took money from me for no reason other than you could... and it was done in a very underhanded manner because if I knew that was the case, I would have handed the items back to the cashier and walked out.  I'd rather pay more for something that to take on that type of sales tactic.  I know there are millions of customers that will take my place, but I will not be there and I will explain to my friends and family to watch out for this rather nasty little cheat."	0	1	0

12699262021_10151328694522022	"  BEWARE !! At the Fayetteville, NC Best Buy I took my daughter's computer in to get fixed. Could access the programs, but had a bad network adapter and occasional blue screening. After getting to the Geek Squad counter it took 30 minutes for him to print a copy of the reciept and do the work order because he was back and forth with me and a blonde girl at the counter too. That irritated me a little at the time. I would have preferred he finished with her before getting to me so I would have had his undivided attention.    Short version, the hard drive was bad and they pulled it without saving the data and sent the harddrive to HP to get their core charge on it for the new hardrive. It was the easiest thing to do. I assumed once they found the problem they would contact me (like they did long ago) before taking any action. Then on the paperwork he put in ""No Data Back-Up"". Who in the hell would ever request that unless it costs something. We had a 3 year ""Best Buy"" warranty in addition to the manufacturers warranty. My daughter is in tears because of the 1000's of pictures, work assignments, art work, etc. she lost because the guy at the counter didn't care. He might as well have burned a bunch of photo albums. If I would have known, I would have downloaded the stuff myself before taking it in.   I requested to speak with a manager and got an associate instead. He was polite, but what can be done now? How would the jerk know to ask if I wanted it backed up without knowing what was wrong with network adapter. Had they done this to my work computer they would be responsible for losing 100s of man hours worth 1000s of dollars. So to my daughter its, ""Sorry, you screwed up and trusted us"". They need to have people digitally sign or initial a block reagrding back-up as part of the procedure so they know and remember to ask for all computer repairs. Damn I'm pissed."	0	1	0

Then the washer leaked out the entire load of water.  Even then we were told that the repairman we had used needed to be the one that came back even though he was on vacation (so we had to wait til he returned).   Meanwhile the water from the leak resulted in significant water damage to our home.  Our floors are being ripped up and need to be replaced.

This is about the 800 customer service line and their complete lack of understanding of the words ""customer service.""  1) Flying home out of ATL.  Called the 800 number to see if I could leave early.  800 customer service said there was an earlier flight available, but there would be a fee of $50.  I took the deal, cancelled rental car/hotel and headed to the airport.  The lady at the counter told me the fee was $150 and that she didn't care what I was told on the phone because...""those overseas customer service agents lie all the time.""  They won because I finally gave up in trying to get a refund.  2) Paid extra for a premium seat upgrade for a flight to LAS.  I had to change flights, but the 800 customer service told me I would get a full refund on my premium seats.  In following up a week later I was told I would get no refund because I voluntarily changed my flight.  3) Booked a flight with family to MCO very early.  Got a notice that the flight changed.  As a result, so did my seat assignments.  We were all together, but not anymore.  That's not a good deal when you're traveling with little ones.  When I called 800 customer service to get all of our seats back together, they told me that I would have to pay a fee.

I asked why they were unable to count to fifteen in an hour and a half and they told me there was a problem with the prescription. BUT THEY NEVER BOTHERED TO CALL US OR THE DOCTOR ABOUT IT!!! Then they told me I was going to have to wait another half hour while they got it ready??!! NOPE. I bashed them and they told me they did not need my abuse. I told them if they could not count to fifteen in less than an hour and half I did not want them handling my prescription anyway. I went over to the TARGET pharmacy, started a new account, and had a filled prescription within 20 minutes!! Walmart--SUPREME UNLIKE-- I will never torture myself with your store again!!"	0	1	0

I bought two Arizona products each for your convenient dollar price. With tax it was $2.11, and I gave the cashier 2$ and 2 dime. Now any other cashier would've given me 9 cent change, but this particular elderly decided to chip in a penny and save me my dime.

I have had nothing but good relations with the branch bank at 481 Prosperity Lake Drive St. Augustine, FL 32092 Phone: 904-810-0645 until today. I have been cashing small checks there for 10 years, maybe one check every four months. I am not cashing my pay checks but things like rebate checks. Today I was being strong armed into opening an account to cash checks. I listened to the rep but after review I declined because of fees they charge. So the outcome of the whole situation once I finished talking with the teller and branch manager was that I either had to open an account and put only a $100 in it a month, or not be able to cash checks. Well for me to change direct deposit and accommodate the $100 deposit is not going to happen. So in conclusion I was told that I need close my two minor accounts and go elsewhere.  Which I am doing next week, whatever happened to the neighborhood banks that kids like me grew up with and enjoyed going to.  Terry Pittman  "	0	1	0

I was a bit blue because I was leaving for work at a time when my son was being scheduled for surgery.  Even though I knew he was in good hands, it was hard to be out of town.  So, because of my participation in the Aadvantage program, I was able to get an upgrade to first class for the leg of the trip from Dallas to Seattle.  I had a sublime glass of wine and an excellent dinner with unobtrusive but friendly service.  The time of the flight was perfect to enjoy a very long extended sunset - continuing to fly west.  The scenery as we reached Seattle was gorgeous.  I don't think that people can often say that their mood is much better after a flight than before it, but mine definitely was that day.

We are totally convinced that Wells Fargo just doesn't care about their costumers! We  are wondering  how it is, that Wells Fargo can take over 2 months to make up their mind on whether or not to give us a loan? But leave us waiting over 6 weeks  for a $500.00 check we were suppose to receive from them within 2 weeks and still haven't received it! We can't believe how crappy Well Fargo Does Business!                                                                                   BTW, we went with another lender, who got our VA approved Loan through in less then 6 weeks.  The same loan that Wells Fargo drug their feet on for over 2 months, made us jump through numerous hoops, then changed under writers in the middle of the process and after all of that denied us in the end. Wells Fargo caused us so many delays that we had to renew the contract on our house 3 times and almost lost it. A house we desperately needed, so we could move my 82 year old, disabled, mother in and care for her.   Thank God the bank who owned the house was very understanding and extended the loan or my mother would still be living alone in the middle of no were, with no one to care for her! Wells Fargo we think you are getting to  big for your britches. What happened to the concept that you are here to make it easier for you customers  to get a loan and own a home?

But, in August of 2012, I had applied to refinance to a15 year mortgage from 30.  I did everything I was asked, signed every document I was given, and I was approved for 15 years at 4 percent.  I was dealing with Lance Eldel, and Taina Guerrie, and the only thing holding us back was the appraisal of te house.  I paid over $500.00 for the appraisal, the guy came, took pictures, and our home came in the numbers needed to finalize approval,  I was told the closing date was to be November 7, 2012, and in fact I requested the day off from work.  Then I get this in my E-mail.   We did but it seems your loan is no longer with bank of America and will not be able to proceed with transaction. I did however advise management to elevate this file for at least a refund of appraisal fee.   Your loan officer should be contacting you shortly.  I have trying to get o hold of the subjects I was dealing with and nobody seems to want answer my questions?  1) What do you mean loan is no longer with BAC?  2) Is someone doing the loan?  3) What loan officer will be contacting? It has been 2 weeks and nobody called.  4) What about the $500.00 plus I paid for appraisal?  I feel I was lied and led to believe that I all was well.

7003656077_10150989592206078	"from Carly Fleischmann. this post was removed...i wonder why??  Dear American airlines, I have been on an airplane over 26 times in my life. I've never had a problem being on the airplane before. However on my way back from LA this year I was met up with the challenge. I am nonverbal however I communicate using my iPad and my computer. Every time I have ever traveled I've always been allowed to keep my iPad on my lap before takeoff and juring landing. My iPad to me is like a voice. Can you imagine being on the airplane and benign asked not to talk for over 25 minutes. When the flight attendants comes around to tell people to turn off all electronic devices it then takes the airplane a while to taxi to the take off strip. I'd like to add at this point that it's statistically proven that 45% of all plane malfunctions are spotted by passengers and not the pilots. Imagine I heard something or saw something and I was unable to comment or say that something was wrong. You are not just putting me in danger by not letting me use an iPad you are putting the whole plane in danger. Also a lot of times any self injuries or problems with the passengers are caused during takeoff and landing. If I'm not able to tell anybody that I'm hurt or injured because I don't have a voice I am in trouble. I am stating all this because on my plane flight back to Toronto. I was asked by the stewardess to turn off my iPad and put it away. When my add told her that I needed it to communicate she started fighting with us. It was not until the captain got involved and agreed that this was a crucial thing for me that I was allowed to keep my iPad. The flight intended still insisted that I put it in front of my seat out of my reach. I was watching the stewardess on the flight the whole trip. She did not stop talking. Imagine asking her not to talk for over 50 minutes. Do you really think she can do it? After watching her I don't think she could. She stated to me that it was the policy of the airlines that i couldn't have my iPad and that with all her years of flying that she's never seen or heard anybody using an iPad to communicate before. But the captain agreed that this is a crucial thing for me. I spoke with the captain during customs and he said that there was no reason why shouldn't be allowed my iPad. Your policies and procedures need to be changed when it comes to people traveling with autism. I think it's something for you guys to take a look at. More people with autism are traveling with iPads and small computers. It's crucial that their voice be heard and that they're able to express themselves the same way other passengers can. Like I said before this is the only airlines I've ever flown that I've had trouble with. All other airlines have agreed that this is a crucial thing for someone with autism. With Wi-Fi and other technology out on airplanes. No stewardess or captain should be complaining about someone with autism using the iPad to communicate. The only answer this airline stewardess could give me was that it was against American airlines policy to have my iPad out. But I'm not like any other passenger. I have autism and my iPad acts as a augmentative devices that allows me to communicate and be heard. I use my iPad during security to ask for further instructions, I use my iPad well waiting for my airplane and ask the reception people when the flights going to take off, I use my iPad on the airplane to tell them if there's something wrong with my seat or my seatbelt or with the airplane. I am begging you as a active passenger on your flights to change your policy when it comes to dealing with people with autism and other special needs. Its time for you to move with the times and understand that a iPad is not just for fun it's for people who really need it too. I would love the opportunity and chance to speak to you and your employees and teach you all about autism and special things you can you do for people traveling with autism. There are more people now in days traveling with autism than ever before. I think it's time that your Airline and your policies change with the times. Don't you? For everyone reading this please express your comments and your concerns. I want to hear what you think?"	0	1	0

I went there to get a product advertised online at a sale price. I got my product, took it to be rang up and it came up as regular priced. I told the cashier about it and she said i needed to get the rewards card to get the sale price. I went through the process to get the card and the item was still ringing up at full price. By this point there was a line forming behind me. They called someone up to ask about it which took ages for that person to get to the register. I asked the cashier to suspend my transaction to help the people in line behind me, but she refused making those people wait longer. So by the time someone arrived to take a look at the item I had, I showed them the online price on my phone and she began arguing with me that that price was only available online. She then called the manager up and he was telling me the same thing, being very rude I might add. I told them that there was no where on the online ad that said it was only on sale online and they continued arguing with me. Its very discouraging that you are advertising things on sale that don't say its only available online for that price. You make it seem as if you can get that item on sale at the store.

78143372410_10150797623632411	Just saw on the news that a Safeway meat cutter in California got suspended for a month for stopping a fight from a guy assaulting a pregnant women.it happened at a Safeway where he worked.I worked for the company for 7 years in 2 states.Safeway did treat me very well and it was a good job.about halfway thru my career there I got in a fight w/a person who was trying to punch me.I defended myself and my manager who was standing right next to me.he told me to go take a walk and I thought I was fired due to the policy about engaging in fighting.my manager came up to me after and said he saw what happened and would stand by my side and keep my job.sorry about the long story but come on Safeway.your just telling the whole country that when we see a women getting hit in a store where u work at(Safeway)we do nothing.so sad	0	1	0
8103318119_10151260421128120	"I just hung up with your online customer service and was not overly pleased with the person that was helping me.  I have always been a fan of Target.....I prefer to shop there for several reasons.  I'm a busy mom of three and we spend a fair share of our income at your store.  Late last night I was doing some online shopping and was about to make a purchase on your website.  I was trying to save the most I could by searching for a discount code online and had found one for an additional $5 off $50, but was unable to get it to work through the link.  It was after midnight eastern time and the item I was purchasing was on sale so I decided since it was so late I would head to bed and try again in the morning.  If I couldn't get it to work in the morning, I'd just forget it and place the order without the coupon.  I logged on this morning only to see that the price was back up to the original price on my order.  Bad luck, I know......so I called your online customer service simply to ask if they could honor the price it was at just last night (which if you google the item for shopping.......the Target option still currenty shows last night's price even though your website no longer does).  After spending over 30 minutes talking to someone.....their answer was 'well, the current price is $xx.xx and if you'd like it for that I can complete the order'.  I guess I am disappointed in seeing that this is how you thank me for being a loyal shopper of your store.  Personally, I didn't think I was asking a lot when I called (it was a $16 price difference).  I can easily order this item from another online retailer at the price I was going to pay last night with free shipping, no sales tax, etc, but I was choosing to buy it from Target.  Sorry for the complaint, but I just wanted to mention how I felt about my experience with your online customer support representative and I hope you take the time to read this and respond. "	0	1	0

Not any more I am afraid. I waited for 4 hours today to get a Samsung Galaxy III. I am an Apple fan boy but wanted to make use of the great deal you had today. Well all I did was wait - I was taken to 5 different counters and told oh sorry the Beast is down - we cant process your transaction. The store manager was very helpful  - he said his team would get it done manually with ATT. I agreed to it. Well anothe wait for an hour and turns out the ATT POS for BBuy doesnt work - hasn't worked for the last 3 weeks. I took my leave - went to the Walmart next doors and went back to being an Apple fan boy and bought the Iphone 5 in less than 15 minutes. I knew you were hurting as a company but didn't realize it was so bad that you don't have the technology and the backup to help with holiday traffic and get you back on your feet again. Well adios, it was a good ride but I simply don't have half a day to spend on going through a simple 15 minute transaction. Good luck"	0	1	0

If this is an example of their customer service, I will never purchase anything from this store. And I would advise everyone else not to purchase anything from this store as well."	0	1	0

She went above and beyond to secure an item for me working with me over the course of a week and she was always quick in her research & in returning calls. She was absolutely fabulous to work with! Honestly, you should consider promoting her or at the very least she should help to train employees because she truly sets the standard in service. She is a rare gem!

HOWEVER, the ""do you want to buy insurance"" when you buy a game is a JOKE.  Two separate titles have been purchased recently that DID NOT WORK. The first required THREE trips to the store before getting a working copy.  The current title is now my second NON WORKING copy.

199504650087085_383601148344100	"With so many options why would you fly the ""Surly Skies""?  I found that I was asking myself and the person I was flying with more than once.  I say, ""Don't Fly The Surly Skies"" and I'll tell you why.  However, should you fly United / Continental Airlines  take a pill of patience and some common sense with you.  Upon final return I left the airport telling myself I'd finally be ""one of those"" to write a compliant letter.  We all usually make all sorts of verbal threats that we are going to do such and such and really - we never do.  A day passes, two and then life paces on at no relent and the issues seem less egregious than it did when the wound was fresh.  This time though, I made myself a promise that if in some small way it made someone else's day better on a future flight with this company or if the CEO or anyone in management read this and saw what was happening at the front lines they would be appalled at how customers were treated and the incredible gull some had to be directly condescending with no filter on tone or volume.  I can't imagine that anyone with any sort of management skills would train their front line first-to-touch-a client in person to act or behave is a manor that is almost sickening when I think about.    Before I continue - do airlines and other companies get that we can and will choose another company?  We don't ""have to"" buy their products or use their service.  In some small way my ticket purchase aided them in keeping their jobs and that is how they treat the folks that made their jobs possible.  I think that might be lost on in the ranks over at United / Continental for sure.  Our story:  We arrived at 4:09 am on Friday, the 13th of April to a warm looking woman with a smile.   I quickly found that warm smile was a guise.  After standing in what was a short line at the crack of dawn we get to the counter at 4:09 am for a 5:50 am flight to Ft. Lauderdale, FL we were told that we didn't make the luggage cut off.  After one minute typing as much text that could wrap around the earth a few time s if each letter were stretched end-to-end and looked to inform us were didn't make the 45 minutes luggage cut off.  We were stunned and defatted and then looked at our watches, which told us we had a few minutes before the cut off.  WE asked if their was anything that she could do to help us and after giving us a lecture on being on time or two hours in advance for a flight she might be able to help and went and talked to someone.  This someone came back and asked where we were flying.  We informed him of our destination and the few minutes we had.  He said ""sure no problem"" and got our bags. IT made us feel like he'd and this woman have someone moved heaven and earth to ""allow"" us to make out flight.  Odd feeling leaving that counter as - we were not past the deadline.   I mustered as my girlfriend and I ran to the gate after what might have been the longest bag fee credit card processing I've ever seen.  10 minutes to run a accredit card to get two bags on?  This after now being at the counter for more than 20 minutes total?  Really?  I somehow don't think it really takes that long and we got the sense that this women with the wily grim was really in some way intentionally trying to make us late.  Having the ""lecture"" on arriving well in advance of our next flight with United we arrived for our return trip to Ft. Lauderdale International Airport to a semi small line of about maybe 75 people and were elated to see such a quick wait on line.  We figured with only 75 people and being 1.5 hours in advance for this flight we were golden.  Oh boy - we couldn't have been more wrong.  I'm now seeing a better picture of how this airlines works, how happy or unhappy in our cases are and so much more about what makes what was once a great company fail so miserably I'll never fly the airline again even if they gave me free tickets.  Just not worth the stress or the hassle when so many other options exist that are happy to not only take our money but happy doing what they do.  Many airlines still over to fly.  This airline and maybe it is due to he merger who knows is not happy to be flying.  Maybe they should ground themselves until they get the point that we are not meat on line waiting t be given a hard time - them security it is worse.    Flying used to be fun.  Even with security it used to be fun.  United?  Not so much fun. sad really.  So, if I were the CEO I'd want to know what was going on in my company at the front lines.  Your front lines are in need of some shake up.  I'd been selfl employed for 30 years and if I saw my employees doing what they were doing they'd be fired or reeducated on the spot. "	0	1	0

Lyric genius I know and initially I whipped out my Shazam to download the song. Unfortunately at this time the music can off bring paused (I was shattered) and moved onto the next line 'MONDAY TUESDAY MONDAY WEDNESDAY FRIDAY THURSDAY'. Here I was a bit confused, its Monday isn't it?  After picking up some Brussle Sprouts (why are they sold?) I continued to hear this music stuck on repeat, come off it for a second and go back to stuttering. I put Shazam away.  I went and asked after 15 minutes why we have been listening to the same words over and over again as it was driving everyone insane. The very nice you I spoke to at checkout said he could not turn off the music as it was centrally managed. Where's the party at? The 'checkout-chick-guy' said it had been doing the same thing for an hour and a half. The song must have repeated 'JANUARY FEBRUARY' 1,256 times (ladies come at me). I felt for this employee as he was clearly distressed and wanted to get out if there ASAP, just like us. He still has another 30 minutes on his shift FYI (That means For Your Information Safeway.

104078918472_10150847105423473	"A letter to USAir   There seems to be a missunderstanding. Our flight to Charlotte was not delayed it was cancelled. You don't seem to understand the difference between a delay and cancellation. Our origional flight never left because the plane was broken. They said it would take hours for a mechanic to arrive at the Charlottesville airport. The plane was there in Charlottesville on the ground from the time we got there, almost two hours before we were supposed to take off.    They knew it was broken when we arrived and lead us to believe we would be taking off on time in it, but they knew we we were never going to take off in that plane.    You people must think I am some sort of fool or something. Why do you write things like ""Due to this delay you would have missed your connecting flight to St. Kitts"" you mean due to the plane being broken and us not telling you, so you could make other arraingements you missed your flight to St. Kitts thus loosing a half a days of vacation.    I asked the girl in Charlottsville if we had time to make our connection to San Juan she said yes, you have plenty of time to make the connection. Maybe if you used planes that weren't broken.  She new we would never make the connection. Your staff in Charlotte when we finally got to the San Juan gate and the plane had been gone for a half hour and I asked what do we do now she said ""I don't know what you are going to do"".    This is entirely your fault. I paid a substantial amount of money for those tickets $2000+ and the for the vacation and $125 just doesn't cut it. Do you really think your $125.00 is going to make up for loosing half a days vacation, putting my wife and 4 year old daughter through this, have you no shame, To send our luggage to JFK (the airport you send luggage to when you can't fit it on the plane with the passanger, you intentionally don't send peoples luggage with them) To have no one in St. Kitts to help us try to locate our bags and just send us out into the night after traveling 16+ hours. Because of you we had to pay for a full day at our hotel even though we got there at 11pm.    Your offer of $125 is just another spit in my face.     Peter  Barboursville VA  "	0	1	0

117497138610_10151170303878611	Dear walgreens. I am a current employee i just transferred from Saint Louis to Show Low Arizona. I noticed a problem on November 6th. I came into work at 7:30am and the register was being slow. Customers were getting impatient and there was nothing I could do. It turns out that there was a software update nation wide and it was bogging our systems down. The pharmacy lost customers and the front of the store lost customers as well because it took anywhere from 5 minutes to 10 minutes for transactions that were being paid by credit/debit. I think that software updates should be done in smaller amounts rather than nation wide it would probably not be such an issue. I like my customers and i want them to keep coming back.	0	0	1

Now there appears to be another storm hitting the same area tomorrow..to be followed by more rain, flooding, possibly snow and undoubtedly by days and nights of cold weather. The so called ""perfect storm"" keeps causing trouble and damage. Local teams, volunteers and many individuals have been mobilizing for days now trying to get much needed aid and supplies to these affected areas. Individuals reaching into their own pockets, buying and donating supplies, collecting donations and spreading the word on what these folks need has been overwhelming and even inspiring.but necessity still has the upper hand and logistical barriers - like the lack of gasoline - has slowed the pace in some instances. That's why we are asking certain major corporations, businesses and other organizations not usually involved in these disaster relief efforts to please step up and do what they can to donate many of the much needed supplies (listed below) that would help in the relief effort.  Your ability to donate ANYTHING you can from the list below would be enormous. During these tough times, many of us simply cannot afford to make individual attempts buying, collecting and delivering the things these victims need in large quantities! We try. We keep collecting, but we really need a little more help.  So here is our request.  If you can commit to donate any of the items below in substantial but reasonable quantities, and deliver them to drop off points (which we will coordinate with the various organizations currently residing and assisting in these affected areas) you would make a tremendous impact in helping us - and our affected communities - move forward! All you need to do is contact me at LocalTheatreNY@gmail.com with what you would like to do or donate and we will help coordinate the distribution of your donations, either directly to the site orr to a nearby redistribution site.  You can also call me directly at 646-285-3033 (leave a message if I don't answer) and I will personally jump on the task to make it move forward. My neighbors, friends, family and co-workers in some of these areas are in need of things I am sure we can find with your help, so please help us get them. I really look forward to hearing from you soon. ANYTHING you could do or donate would help! Roger Here is the list:  . cleaning products (especially disinfectants & bleach) . Heavy Duty Rubber Gloves . Masks . Towels for cleaning . Mops & Buckets with wringers (slop buckets) . Non-perishable food . Underwear (Kids, Womens, Mens, Depends - all sizes) .

Soon, the U.S. Supreme Court will decide the Shell vs. Kiobel case -- a precedent-setting case that would allow corporations to literally get away will murder and no longer be held accountable in U.S. courts for crimes they commit overseas.

I am not behind in my mortgage, I am not in debt (other than my home), I don't skip paying bills, in other words, I'm responsible and got caught up in a housing market crash that was not due to anything I did...e.g. bought more house than I could afford. Well, I was told yesterday that I would now close on November 5th, but the loan officer in the next breath said that it would be 7 to 10 days for final review...hmmm my math says 7 to 10 days is going to make the closing no earlier than November 9 and could be as late as 15th (the 12th is a bank holiday). Also, I asked for an itemized schedule of the closing costs they want paid at closing - not a hard request, the loan officer sent it and in very small font above the schedule was written ""borrower must provide two months of 401K statements and withdrawl terms"". Um, this is the first time I was asked for this and with a three hour time difference, I did not receive the email until after COB on the East Coast (I live in AZ).

I chose Delta Airlines for my recent family vacation and it was by far the most horrible travel experience of my life. After paying $25 per bag to check our luggage, I arrived at my destination to find that one of my bags did not arrive. It was never put onto the first plane. The bag was promised to be delivered to me by 4am the following day, and it arrived late...as had our flight. Then the airline decided to change their flight times which left my husband and I as well as our two young children with a 5 hour layover on our return trip. When I tried to see about changing this flight I was quoted an additional $800!! After spending the better part of our day at the Detroit airport, we boarded the plane only to meet another hour-long delay....the plane was over the weight limit and bags, as well as passengers, would need to come off. Of course when we arrived at our destination my bag was, once again, nowhere to be found, only this time they have  no idea where it went, or if it will be found! This  is absolutely ridiculous and inexcusable. never in my life have I experienced such awful service from a company. When I called to ask for my $25 baggage fee to be refunded for each time my bag was lost I was told that I can send an email request but they can't guarantee anything. What a joke!

Mildly miffed, I re-wrote everything an e-mail to that address, only to receive a MAILER DAEMON failure notice that the system was unable to deliver the message! I'm no longer sighing. Frustratedly, I go to united.com and re-enter everything into your ""Contact Us"" page. I get an auto-reply saying that it is ""peak flying season"" (Mid-May? Really?) and that there may be a delay getting back to me. Days later, still no response. I'm getting the ""it's not you, it's me"" break-up vibe from you. "	0	1	0
77978885595_10151159000235596	"Why is PetSmart stopping the discount on canned cat food? There's now a restriction on how many and what flavor you can purchase before rec'ing the advertised in-store discount with s PetPerks card. For instance, today I was forced to purchase a 24-pk of Friskies canned cat food (one flavor) in order to receive the rate @ 53 cents a can. (It used to be 40 cents per can, until recently, btw.) Frankly, the PetPerks card is swiftly becoming useless. Perhaps it hasn't occurred to you that we're in a recession and not everyone can afford to purchase 24 cans at a time? Or that that some cats don't enjoy eating one flavor of food all the time, especially in a multi-cat household? Really, really disappointed in your policies. Your store is already expensive, now it's restrictive. Something's gotta give to keep your customers happy."	0	0	1

As it was thawing I noticed that there was alot of Ice between the chicken breasts so I decided to weigh it.  It turned out to have almost a half kg of ice in the box.  I just called Head office to see if they can address the problem perhaps call the warehouse were the chicken gets packaged.  I was blessed with wonderful operator that received my call who lacked costumer service skills, dry and I could tell she was rolling her eyes when I was speaking. She told me to go back to the store and talk to the manager.  All I wanted is them to call the warehouse who packages the chicken and advise the chicken was underweight and to fix the problem so it does not happen to the rest of Canade.   I was not impressed so I asked to speak to a manager.  The supervisor was polite and told me that the district manager would return my calll.  That was today, I will keep you posted to see what happens. "	0	1	0

I told pharmacist I had been there for nearly 30 minutes waiting, said she was only one there.  I told her I needed to pick up my Rx's, and then had to sit and watch her fill 5 of them when she returned, and said the automated Rx for some reason would not let her refill, even though it was due on Friday.

My husband and I both lost our jobs last year and had to move six hours up state in order to find work in his specified field.  The bad part of this is it took BofA four months to realize that I have a FHA loan (WHY so LONG)  and the person at BofA has yet to call me to inform me of their decision even though I have sent emails asking for the status of the short sale.  I had to hear it from my broker instead of B of A.  It's not like we wanted to give up our HOME (our first home too that we loved) but we had no choice, we could not afford to rent a house and continue making a mortgage payment too.  Foreclosure is set for this Tuesday July 3rd.....aren't there any other options besides a foreclosure?  And if so why hasn't someone tried to call me for options?   I can only assume all the rumors are true....B of A makes more money off foreclosures than they do short sales etc.  Especially since our government continues to bail each bank out for each home they foreclose on.....

I have flown extensively around the world (to over 30 countries) and with multiple airlines and this is by far the worse experience I haver had. After arriving to airport and and being told that they oversold my flight and will not be accommodating me on the flight I paid full fare for on a one way so that I could have the flexibility to retur home as soon as possible. fast forward past several other discourtesies from the American Airlines airport staff they end up accommodating me at the most shoddy Hotel ever. I call down to the front desk and ask the concierge which direction does the sunset in respects to my room. she seems confused so i try to simplify it for her by asking what direction is west? her response, yes the sun set in the west. i'm confirm with her that I know which the direction the sunsets , and try again by asking does the sun set towards the water. her response it did today but i dont know where it will set tomorrow though. Later I call down for roomservice to order a meal and they tell me their only restaurant  opens at 7pm on a friday night and they are serving BBQ on the beach. I tell them I am vegetarian and would like to order something else. He says they aren't sering anything else... Hes like, do you eat rice and potatoes i can give you some of that. I understand Profits come first with American Airlines. But the very least you could do after screwing over your customers, is to accomodate them at a decent vetted hotel. Already dealt an unpleasant experience, is asking for accommodations where you can have a decent meal too much to expect. And at the very least a hotel where its staff have IQs within 2 deviation points from the standard (i.e within 95th percentile). *update the restaurant calls back would you like any drinks with your meal (rice and potatoes). yes, can i ave a coke and water please. your with the airlines right? yes. well you can have a coke but you would have to pay for the bottle water yourself. you can order as much coke as you want but no water.

While I appreciate that I can ""Chat with a Live CSR"", I'd also like the option of simply sending an email.  Second, and the reason for this message: I love Online Banking and being able to request a check to pay vendors. It's especially useful as I am currently working overseas and it's so easy to just log in and pay bills.   When I signed up for Online Banking years ago, I really appreciated that I could, for example, request a check today (Sunday) and, barring a federal/state holiday, have it reach my vendor by, say, Tuesday. Now, I request a check and the wait can be nearly a week. What is the reason for the delay? If you have my banking information and you can see my available balance and I've requested a check for which there are clearly funds, why is there a delay? It would be great if you could go back to releasing and issuing funds within 48 hours or less.  Thanks for your time. I look forward to your response.  Sincerely,  Janet Kincaid"	0	1	0

Although I can't believe these words are spewing from my fingers, I'm envious of my elite bretheren over at UA. The reason why, you ask? Because they have a system in place to check on their location on a flight's upgrade list, PRIOR to arriving at the airport. The inability to do this is really one of the only downsides to your upgrade system.  I know I'm not alone when I say, ""please...PLEASE add this feature!"" It will really enhance the elite experience. If possible, allowing one to see what their placement on the upgrade list would be prior to booking a flight would be great, too. Allowing elites that have a bit more flexibility in their travels plans the opportunity to pick a flight that gives them the best chance for an upgrade would be great.  Oh, and while I'm at suggesting things: I think it would be great for F passengers (and EXP) to get vouchers for free wifi. This is such a small relative added cost (and requires almost no overhead to implement), but really differentiates your product."	0	0	1

12699262021_10150615174952022	"Dear Best Buy,    Today has been a long and disappointing day. It began with a doctors visit for my son, which then let into a pharmacy visit for his medication. The medication cost was minimal, just a dollar or so. I swiped my card to pay for his meds and was turned down. It said I had insufficient funds. Now, grant it, I did not have a whole lot to begin with, who does now days, but when I left this morning I had enough money to buy his medication. I scraped for enough money lying around in the car and managed to pay for his meds! A blessing in itself!   When I reached home, I promptly got onto the internet and checked my bank account to see what had happened. There in black and white , you, Best Buy, had taken the remaining balance out of my account leaving me with $0.00. I called my bank to alert them that this purchase had not been made by me. They asked me to call Best Buy first to see if we could solve the problem because I had a legitimate reason to believe that the money had been taken out due to a problem with our anti-virus (I'm not going to go into all the details now. I have already with customer service). So I was pretty sure (almost positive) that no one had gotten our card number and that it was just a legit problem with the best buy system.  That is no problem I understand systems messing up sometimes.   I proceeded to call your closest store, Best Buy (Alabaster, AL), to see what we could do about my anti-virus problem and the money problem. They were very nice and did their best to tell me what I needed to do for my anti-virus; however, they could not help me with the money problem but they did think it was due to a problem in the system. They gave me the proper numbers to call and wished me well. The number I received was 1-888-BEST BUY.   I called this number and was hung up on 6 times while trying multiple options when my correct option didn't work. When I did EVENTUALLY reach a real live person, I could not understand a word he said and he sounded annoyed the entire conversation. Then after telling him everything that happened, I was told that he could do nothing for me nor tell me anything that happened or why or when or what this money went for without a purchase number which I don't have because I did not make a purchase.  He told me that the only thing I could do was call my financial institution and have them solve it. So after biting my lip the entire conversation, as well as holding back tears the whole time; I did my best to BE respectful, and not show just how angry I was. They were taking my money and could not even tell me what for.  Reluctantly, I had to call my bank and cancel my card. I not only have to live with $0.00 in my account for the next few days, but when filing a claim I also found out that Best Buy was set up to take that money out every month.  I don't know what was going on ,Best Buy, but you should at least be able to tell me what it was going towards. Maybe there could have been something that we purchased MON THS ago that is just now coming out in increments. (I am pretty sure that that is NOT the case.. But I am only human forgetfulness runs in this species) But because you could tell me NOTHING, it makes me think that you just felt like taking out my money. I hope that's not the case, but when I get hung up on 6 times, and then finally receive an unhelpful representative, it feels like your company just does not care.  Since I have nothing else to go off of, I guarantee you that Best Buy will never see my debit card number again for fear that I will be robbed of all the funds in my account AGAIN. I knew of no other way to complain without having to call your customer service again and I not about to do that. So here it is on Facebook for you to see.  Thank you  Your disgruntled accidental customer, Charlotte"	0	1	0

You should have really taken a step back and thought long and hard about this decision. My husband and I are currently in Korea and we are not able to fly pets on Patriot Express like other overseas duty stations such as Europe. Our dog is a mix breed and weighs 65lbs by himself minus the kennel.

So please take actions before it is too late. Acknowledge the problems and ask for forgiveness and understanding. I am sure you can turn this crisis around.

When I got there, the employee asked if he could help me. I asked him to pull up my pre orders and asked what I had on pre order. He told me that I had only 3 games on pre order, which were games that were not out yet. I knew for a fact that I still had Borderlands 2 and a darksiders 2 season pass reserved, which he did not mention. Concerned by this, I mentioned that to him and he finally admitted that I had them reserved, but still tried hiding that I had other games reserved. I confronted him about that as well. He got his manager on duty to help me. She let me know that I in fact did have other games reserved. It was a total of $35 of credit that the previous employee tried hiding from me. I was all ready to take my old pre orders and put them towards some upcoming releases, but I was afraid another rude employee would try to hide my credit if I did not pick up the games I would have reserved. I am now afraid to even pre order anything over there. I am just writing this hoping that someone recognizes why I am so disappointed with a store I have been shopping at for 5 years.

I went in last night to purchase a pair of shoes for my husband and there were only 2 pairs available in his size, one was the display pair and the other was on the shelf and was filthy dirty. When I asked the manager if there were any others available, he rudely told me to get over it, it is just dirt and that if I gave him a couple minutes he would go in the back and blow off the dirt. He also said that the the display shoes are switched out every other day so any shoe you purchase from the shelf was probably at one time a display shoe. If I wanted to purchase ""used"" shoes, I would go to a thrift store and save myself some money. I also think that the young manager EVAN on duty last night needs an attitude adjustment and needs to learn how to treat a customer if Dick's would like to remain in business.And forget calling customer service! They are just as rude! After the horrible treatment I receievd last night, I will not be back."	0	1	0

7003656077_10150799628421078	"My name is Juan Aguayo and I purchased my international flight through CheapOair tickets. However, the schedule of my flight arrived in New York (LGA) with a connection flight from New York (JFK). The problem is that American Airlines requires a 2 hour arrival before the departure but the connecting flight only left me 2 hours in between the two airlines, when the distance in between the two airports takes a minimum of 1 hour with no traffic. These two airports are not in a rural area, but rather New York. It is nearly impossible for me to make a connecting flight with the traffic through New York. So I will  not be able to make my connecting flight which will result in a loss of the ticket and I will miss the rest of my flights to get my to my destination. So in order to make my connecting flight I had to change the arrival time at LGA, but by doing this, I was charged 350.00 dollars. This was not my mistake, because the scheduling was made poorly. I should not have to pay any money to fix what was not my error. I am very frustrated because visiting a dying relative and the only solution that the airline gave me was to pay almost 400.00 dollars to change this. I do not have money to be paying fees, and the cost of the ticket alone is more than I can afford. Can someone please help me? I can confirm all of this information."	0	1	0

12699262021_10151275819212022	"Best Buys Customers   Be WARNED, Best buys is excellent at the BAIT and SWITCH. They will bait you to come in the store, but the good advertise merchandise will be OUT OF STOCK, or UNAVAILIBLE. You might want to check with the BBB.ORG at the complaints from last year. Last year Best Buy ruined our Christmas. You might want to Skip Best Buys and go directly to walmart.com  This is what happen to me last year  I want to warn people of Best Buy ability to commit fraud and break purchase agreements with lies of Back Order, Not Available or No Longer in Stock. If I was a vender and sold Best Buy merchandise then on the date of delivery tell Best Buy that the price went up on the merchandise, that they had to pay more for it, or that it was unavailable, best buy would have me in court, suing me for Fraud, or Breaking a purchase agreement. I would have been a good customer, with purchasing accessories for the camera and laptop, but instead, Best buy wanted to use my purchases as a end of the quarter sales figures to dupe their investors and stock holders. Over my lifetime I could have spent thousands of dollars, but instead they choose to do me wrong forcing me to become a lifetime buyer from their competitors. Here is my story on how Best buy Ruined my wife's first Christmas in the USA.  Best Buy wants to say that the camera I purchased online for $168. on 12-1-2011 was not the camera they kept selling on their website for $279.99, but had the same model number and sku number on my bill of sale. I purchased a SONY CYBERSHOT DSCTX10 16.2MP/4X/3.0"" W (SKU 2424392). It was to be delivered on 12-10. On 12-10, I got e-mail that it was on back order, on 12-12, I got another e-mail that it was still on back order, then on 12-14 I got a email that said ""Thank you for your interest in SONY CYBERSHOT DSCTX10 16.2MP/4X/3.0"" W (SKU 2424392) on BestBuy.com.  Your order is currently on backorder; and unfortunately, we will not be receiving more product.  As a result your order will be canceled. We are sorry for this and apologize for any inconvenience this may have caused. I logged onto best buy website, Lo and Behold, they had this camera on sale for $279.99 ($50 off regular price) guaranteed delivery before Christmas. I called Customer service, I was told they have the camera in stock, but not at the price I paid for it. I could pay the extra $111 and they would mail it to me. I asked to speak to a supervisor. They hung up on me, I called back, waited on hold another 20 minutes, Again I was told this camera was not available at the price I paid for it. Again I asked to speak to a supervisor, again they hung up on me. So I wrote Brian Dunn the CEO of Best Buy e-mail, never got a response. I went to their facebook page, wrote my complaint, I was told to read their disclaimer. After writing 3 different complaints on facebook, best buy sent me a response that they were going to send me a e-card for the $168 to use online so my wife ordered a Sony-VAIO Laptop / Intel CoreT i3 Processor / 14"" Display / 4GB Memory-Pink-VPCEG2DFX/PC   SKU: 4001998 spent $515, to be delivered on 12-28, on 12-28 I got the e-mail saying We're sorry, but the item you ordered is not available for pickup at the WARNER ROBINS GA Best Buy store #1185. If you still want this product, call us toll-free at 1-888-BEST BUY (1-888-237-8289) to check product availability at a different store or warehouse, or to have the item shipped via free standard shipping. Please contact us within 8 days to choose one of these options. For faster service, tell us the order number when you contact us. So I called, because my wife was at work, they would not let me do anything, so I called my wife, she was upset, and had me cancelled the order. My Opinion of Best Buy, is to NEVER buy any thing from Best Buy, I will start using walmart.com. Wal-Mart at least will guarantee delivery something Best Buy cannot do, and wal-mart will match any price. I am asking everyone who has this problem and ruined Christmas by best buy inability to do good business and provide service of things they sale, is to use walmart.com  who will provide good service of anything you purchase online and guarantee delivery, something that Best Buy cannot do.

102621172007_10151333918392008	"I would like to bring to your attention an incident that happened to me over the summer when your company first started accepting manufacturer coupons. I was trying to use some P&G coupons which clearly stated 4 like coupons in same transaction per shopping trip per day. Well there was a cashier at your location on Crescent Street in Brockton, Massachusetts. He was very rude with me and told me I could only use one of the coupons per my entire order. I know that was not the case and had your coupon policy in hand. He argued with me in front of other customers. He claimed himself to be a manager but I sure hope he was not. He stated he had to go outside before he got really heated and said things to me that he would regret. Point being if your employees are going to continue treating customers who use coupons at your store who shopped at your store regularly before you even started accepting coupons, well frankly you are going to lose a lot of customers due to your employees thinking they can treat customers like crap because we coupon. I know there have been a lot of other issues in other stores in other states as well. I am in multiple coupon groups and hear their stories of the bad service they received at their local Dollar Trees due to the fact that they were simply trying to save a few dollars. I strongly suggest you make a change regarding this matter. Or else you are going to lose a lot of business. If it is such an issue and we are going to continue to be treated so poorly, you may as well just stop accepting the manufacturer coupons. This is simply getting out of hand. I would have written to you when this happened, but I did not know how to contact your company regarding this matter. Just know that I will never shop at a Dollar Tree again. It is not worth my aggravation. Now picture 1 million other customers thinking and feeling the same way. What do you think the outcome will be... Have a good day."	0	1	0

12699262021_10151304911037022	"I would like to share my story of the worst customer service I have ever encountered.  I assumed it would be easy to do ""site to store"" and just swing in your store and pick up my order, boy was I WRONG!! I ordered an Xbox 360 bundle with Kinect and 3 games and chose store #547 on Jonestown Road in Harrisburg, PA for the pick-up .  After placing my order on the Best Buy website I received an email stating there was a billing problem encountered and I needed to call 1-888-BEST BUY. I called the number and spoke with a wonderful customer service rep who said there was a ""glitch in the system but it is all fixed and you will get another email when your order is ready."" She also mentioned if I got another email about a billing problem to call them back. About 1 hour later I got another email again stating there was a billing problem encountered. So I called customer service back again, I was on the phone for 45 mins with a rep again trying to work out the billing problem. I was told that the ""glitch in the system"" saying my card was being denied. I checked my credit card balance and low and behold I was charged $370 TWICE!  Which I don't understand as I only placed the order once. I was told I would be refunded the amount but since it takes 24-48 hours for my bank to release the funds I would have to wait to place the order again. I asked if I would still be able to get the sale price for the xbox bundle as it was only a 2 day sale. Customer service said ""No, we would have to charge the full amount as it won't be on sale when you order it again. After explaining that I was not the one who made the mistake I should still get the sale price since I did order it during the sale. This is where I should of realized something was majorly wrong and just went to Target and gotten the xbox there and been done with it. Then customer service said I could call my bank and do a 3 way call to have my bank release the funds so Best Buy could again run my credit card to get approval to purchase the xbox.  I was assured by the rep that she was ""putting notes in my account that would make the problem crystal clear for the next rep to fix"". I was given a case # and I told customer service I would call right back with the number for my bank. I called back about 5 mins later and got a different service rep I tried to give her the bank's phone # but she said ""that is not needed, your card is being denied for lack of funds, that is not our problem. "" I explained that I most certainly had enough funds to purchase the xbox or I would not have placed the order online. I tried to give the rep my case #, she again she said did not need it. After arguing with this rep for 20 mins she finally realized that Best Buy was making the mistake and said she was fixing all the problems and would submit my order for site to store pick up. I was elated that my problem was finally fixed. Again, I was dead wrong.  I waited about 1.5 hours and headed to store #547 in Harrisburg,PA to pick up my xbox. When I arrived I was told my order was not ready but would be ready ""very soon"". I asked if I could wait, I was told yes. I walked around the store for about 45 mins and then returned to pick up my order. I was told it was still not ready. I again asked how long it would be and was told ""just a few minutes"". So after waiting again the rep at site-to-store pick up had another employee get me the xbox off the store room floor. I checked out and headed home with my xbox. I thought my saga was over, again I was wrong. I received a call around 8:45 p.m. which woke me up from bed. I was asked for the serial number off the box as the rep did not write it down when checking me out. I got the number and went back to bed.    2 days (it was a Friday) later I got a call asking me to call back ""immediately"" so I did, I was told that there an error and my credit card was charged but then refunded so basically I never paid for the xbox I now have at home. It was explained to me that what happened is that I got an xbox off the store room floor since my order was not ready when I arrived at the store. then  my ""site-to-store"" order was canceled since I did not pick it up when I had already picked up the xbox I got from the store room floor, so Best Buy refunded my credit card. I asked if I could give my credit card info over the phone as the store in Harrisburg is about 30 mins from my home, I was told no I needed to come into the store to pay for the xbox and needed to come in that day. I explained that I had plans and could not come in that night. I spoke with a manager named Jazz who said it would be ok as long as I could stop in by Sunday. Jazz was very nice and assured me everything was taken care of and all I had to do was just stop in the store ""for 5 mins"".  So Sunday afternoon I receive a voicemail stating I had ""til 7pm or it was out of Best Buys hands"" Im still not sure what they meant by that. I surly did not steal the xbox so I don't know what was out of their hands. I headed out to store #547 in Harrisburg with the xbox and credit card to finally get this mess taken care of. I had noticed that the box the xbox came in was damaged and I asked if I could get a replacement as I don't want to give an xbox with a damaged box. After waiting about 15 mins I was told there were no more xboxs in stock like I purchased so I would just have to deal with a damaged box or return it before January 17th.  Well after 2 trips and countless hours I was not going to make another trip to exchange the damaged box.  I was speaking with a Customer service rep named Jen, she had an attitude with me from the moment we started speaking. She said she was sorry but there was nothing she could do. I don't understand how I spend $370 and there is nothing you can do. I asked if I was going to get a gift card or some other form of compensation for dealing with the multiple phone calls and multiple trips to the store. Jen rudely replied ""No, we won't issue a gift card for this problem"". I told her that when I spoke w/ Jazz on Friday he said to speak with a manager and they would do something for me. I asked Jen to speak with a manager so she walked about 3 feet from me and approached who I think was a manager who said ""why would we give her anything?"" I don't think he wanted me to hear that but being 3 feet from me I could still hear him, that manager did not even come over to talk with me. He simply walked away. Jen came back to me again with a major attitude and said I would need to speak with Jazz since he was the person I spoke with on Friday, Jazz was at lunch but would be returning in 5 mins. I said I would again wait to be helped. 5 mins turned into 15 mins and by that time I was fuming mad. Jen came back over to me and said that Jazz was back from lunch but was tied up with something else and asked if I again could wait. After waiting another 10 mins that look in my face must of said ""extremely pissed off"" because another service rep came up to me to see if she could help, I wish I had gotten her name as she was extremely nice and understanding, unlike Jen. After hearing me rehash my story to this new rep Jen came back over to me and said she would give me a gift card. I don't understand how Jen told me only Jazz could help me when in reality Jen was the one who issued me the gift card $20, wow thanks a lot best buy.    I understand weird things happen but I don't appreciate the attitude from Jen.  I will not be returning to this store for any reason. I hope this reaches the correct person and some resolution is made.  "	0	1	0

I walked into your Azusa, CA store today and the manager there started our conversation by telling me how they are negative for the day and how his day is awful.  Your return policies are terrible and customer service is some of the worst I have experienced.  Look at a company like Apple.  Yeah, they do a lot of returns and favors for customers, some of which they might lose money on, but in the long run they make much more money because people trust them.  Their employees actually want to be there.  The customers believe in the place they bought their product from.  They trust that if their product has an issue they will be there to back them up.  Gamestop is the exact opposite.  I feel like I am rushed out the door with a product I know I will never have support for.  What kind of company do you want to be?"	0	1	0

Long story short they said that in order to use the gift certificate I just bought, I'd have to purchase the ticket in person at the ticket counter.  Before I purchased the gift certificate I asked if I could use them online.  The ticket agent said yes and showed me the certificate number to enter in when making the online reservation.

On more than one occasion I have purchased foul tasting food, expired food and encountered rude employees. Below you will find my timeline of disappointments: November 2011 - I purchased packaged Salmon from the open refrigeration unit. When I got home and opened the fish it had a strong fishy odor. Fish typically does not begin to smell like this until it begins to go bad. I did not return the fish; I simply threw it out as I was too frustrated to walk the six blocks back to the store.  February 2012  . I purchased a rotisserie chicken from the deli area. I purchased this chicken in the evening , got  it home to discover that it was old and dry . I tried a new brand of red sauce only to find it flat and tasteless, I returned it with the dry old chicken March 2012 - Hot-n-fresh bread-This was an ongoing battle until I recently gave up.  I would show up at 5:00 for fresh bread, there was none,  repeat.   April 2012 - Today I picked up a package of oscar mayer bun length hot dogs, upon returning home I noticed four of the eight dogs were pale brown the other four looked pink.  I returned to the store to exchange them only to find upon my return home that the sell by code was expired on the new ones!  By 3 days! The employees are less than friendly   This store is closer to me than the local Jewel, but Id rather walk the distance to get fresh food, good service and quality meat, bread and vegetables.   This location requires your attention, I can't be the only one noticing the effects of poor management.  For now, Ill take the longer walk to Jewel. Tony "	0	1	0

60686173217_10151094772933218	"ok......SERIOUSLY? When is Kroger's in Madisonville KY going to do something with the RUDE woman ANGELA?? It is obvious she not only has an attitude problem (yet you have her working customer service!?!), but she has a problem with couponer's! A couple of weeks ago while I was couponing there she was so rude to me and told me I needed to go shop somewhere else! After talking to a manager, calling corporate, then talking with the main person in Madisonville MR Berry, I was told ANGELA would be dealt with. I was given an apology, a gift card, and a free pie for my ""troubles"" I have been in the store several times since then and still see ANGELA working customer service. Then yesterday I was told by a fellow couponer that she was treated badly by ANGELA and was also told to shop somewhere else. After she talked to a manager, and they resolved her issue and gave her a gift card as well. How about you deal with the ANGELA woman and you won't have to be running behind her and fixing all the problems she causes. We don't want a gift card, or an apology (which came from the store not ANGELA's mouth) We want to be able to shop @ Kroger's without being treated like sh#t for being couponer's. If the store doesn't like couponer's quit taking coupons!! Simple as that! Because at this point ALL of the women that I know that are die hard couponer's like myself can find another store. Kroger's needs to decide if one bad employee is worth losing that much business!! I know for myself I do not just coupon there! I get my medicine filled at Kroger pharmacy, I get my gasoline at the Kroger fuel station, etc. I really used to look forward to my trips to Kroger's......now I just dread even going there.........."	0	1	0

Sadly why they had to make what used to be simple/seamless so complicated is beyond me.   I had a segment that was waitlisted later this week with a RPU. Since we know how unreliable the flight notification system is I check my itineraries as the date nears and probably more often when waitlisted. Tonight I checked it and low and behold I have the following messages on the PNR on united.com -  - !A modification has been made to your itinerary. Please contact United Reservations to have your ticket reissued.  - This flight segment can be confirmed. Please contact United Reservations for assistance.  So I call United and it recognizes the number I am calling from and ask if it's speaking to me. I confirm that it is me. Then the automated system asks what I need and I mention existing reservations. The automated system asks for my PNR which I give it and it finds the existing reservation I am calling about. It confirms the departure city, arrival city and date. Following that it asks for my last name and once I confirm the last name it spells out my first and middle name asking if that's correct. Once I confirm the name is correct I am connected to an agent who asks me for all the same crap the automated system just asked. Tell the agent united.com is saying my upgrade has been confirmed and once the agent verifies that he goes to reissue my ticket.  Major pain in the a$$ especially when the old system just required two prompts to get to an agent (Reservations / INTL or DOM). Then again I rarely had to call reservations when an upgrade had cleared since I could just choose my seat online.   Can I say I miss Apollo and our old 1K reservations desks?? "	0	1	0

100488814000_10151002255494001	"""Tell me the company you keep, and I'll tell you what you are.""  By siding with the likes of Monsanto, Kellogg's has made it evident the company with which it surrounds itself.  I think I can therefore with reasonable certainty make an accurate assessment of ""what"" Kellogg's truly is. Typically, businesses are interested in finding out and providing what their consumer base wants.  It's just good business sense.  Why then does Kellogg's stand against the wishes of more than 90% of the general public in the fight for labelling GMOs? Furthermore, if GMO's are as safe as they say, why not spend money on proving that to us instead?  Why go to such lengths to cover-up the truth? I cannot think of a time in my life when I felt compelled to cover up anything other than wrongdoing. If no wrong is being done here, then why the big cover-up? I can only deduce that Kellogg's is a wrongdoer. I've been a loyal consumer of Kellogg's products since childhood, but Kellogg's has betrayed me and  dishonored my loyalty. It is clear that Kellogg's doesn't care about me as a person or a customer. I will be joining the boycott of all Kellogg's products until Kellogg's proves to me they care about more than profit margins.  Goodbye Kellogg's!"	0	1	0

We told them we wanted some resolution, so they proceeded to interrogate the employees at the Rockaway Best Buy store about me, including finding out that I had dated a friend of an employee for a month about 3.5 years ago. They then proceeded to call J.P. to ""fix"" everything, and wound up telling him that he and I were lying about the whole thing and that I had some personal vendetta against Best Buy. J.P. stood by our version of events, so now the GM of the Rockaway store is pulling surveillance video and the phone customer service reps are pulling audio tape so that they can see that we were indeed lied to and hung up on and that our version of events was not fabricated in any way.

Not only did the flight take off 2 hours later than scheduled time ( which is horrendous when you travel with kids ), we had the misfortune of being greeted at Chicago by an extremely rude gate attendant . We finally reach Pittsburg only to find out from baggage claim office that our bags had been routed to Rochester and Washington D.C( huh ???). We were assured that our bags would be delivered to our finland address in Seven Springs . 7 calls to their toll free number and being misinformed about exact location every time left us extremely frustrated and angry. Our bags contained not only our clothes but also formal wear that we absolutely needed, and last but not the least medications that we could've needed( cant exactly carry all medication in hand luggage). 36 hours later, we finally found that our bags had been rerouted from Pittsburg to DC ( again) to Altoona. The staff at Altoona seemed like the only people who wanted to and did help us out. We finally had our bags delivered to us 48 hours later than we should've . Few questions 1- why we're we not told the truth about the location and arrival of our bags ? Toll free number agents had no clue and no interest in the truth. 2 - Pittsburg airport had our bags for 24 hours before passing them on to DC ( again) and Altoona.What gave them the right to do this?  3-  united claims that they are all about customer service . We have chosen to fly United always and now question that decision.  Our trip that was supposed to have been an enjoyable trip with 3 kids was utterly ruined . We made memories alright , jus not the kind we were looking to make . We are scheduled to make more trips, do we just send our bags a month in advance with stops which are not even on our itinerary?

Well, I went in with the defective XBox and told them what happened, that it quit working after 20 minutes and they asked for my receipt and ID, which I handed over.  I went and picked up another XBox off the floor, and 5 minutes later my XBox and the 2 year Black Tie I bought with it were exchanged and I was heading out the door.   Simple as that.  But note that I was polite, not whiny, and not screaming about how I had to drive half an hour out of my way just to return it and demanding that I be compensated for my time.  In other words, I acted like an adult and was treated like one.    Best Buy has great customer service for good customers.  But if you go in as a whiny little brat, don't be surprised if they treat you like a child as any company is going to do.  Also notice that I didn't wait until after the return period to bring it back either.  When I found out that it was defective, I immediately brought it back in, I didn't wait over a month to bring it in just to complain that they wouldn't take it back since it was over the return period.  This post is to show people that Best Buy treats their customers well.  Yes, there are a few exceptions to the rule because when you have over 200 million customer per year, common sense dictates that there will be some issues.  Thought most of the complaints we see on this board are not real customer service issues, but rather people who want something for nothing because they weren't intelligent enough to read the policies that are on the HUGE BLUE SIGN on the wall, by all the registers, and right on the back of their receipts.

Please consider this complaint and allow me to make the booking at the original price.  Some of the events that have happened could be a basis for trying legal road of solving this problem, but I believe it is better to avoid such extreme solutions.  First of all, over 2 weeks ago on 28th of February 2012 I made a reservation of a ticket from Geneva to San Francisco. The displayed price (I attach the confirmation e-mail) was 961.80 BRL. The credit card I provided was unlawfully charged 961.80 USD but the ticket was not issued.  I connected with the customer service to learn that the card can not be accepted (which I do not understand becasue it was charged at least temporarly). In the response I provided a different credit card number (card issued in a different country). I also rebooked flight to go from Geneva to Oakland (CA) as this connection was considerably cheaper. The ticket was not issued again. I called the customer service after 24h. The agent was not sure what is the problem but after some time promised to have a look at the process and asked me the billing address of the card again.  The ticked was not issued during next 3 days after which I tried to contact United several times (With extremely long connection times). During the whole process I was proposed to connect later and the reservation had the  confirmed status.  Tonight I called the service again to learn that there was still problem with the credit card I provided. I gave numbers of 2 of my credit cards (French and Polish). None of them was accepted even if I used one of them 1h earlier to purchase product over Internet. Later I tried with a Spanish card belonging to my friend but the situation repeated. While talking with my friend from the US, he proposed me to use his credit card. I gave the details to the agent. It seemed to be accepted because after this operation I refreshed the web page displaying my reservation and I noticed a change. The price of the ticket went from original 603 EUR to 930 CHF. I was informed that it was my fault because I provided wrong data before (Which is clearly not true as the card was charged at the first place).  The 2 weeks that have passed since I created the reservation made prices go up and destroyed my chances of fying with different airlines.  yours Piotr Praczyk"	0	1	0

Just wanted to say thank you giving me a credit card when I was 17 years old and burying me in debt through out college because I was naive and didn't know the consequences. Don't worry I have made something of myself and graduated college now, but guess what...now you won't accept my application for a new credit card because I couldn't pay off my last one during college even though I had two jobs (it is now paid off). You guys really know how to prey on young people and put them under debt before they can even graduate and give them no help during rough times. Great job on targeting the young and oblivious to make more money. Your system does not make sense that you will give a 17 year old a credit card with no questions asked, but when it comes to a 23 year old with a full time job I have been rejected THREE TIMES! Seems like you have a pretty good system of exploiting the youth.  Sincerely, Andrew Keifer Johnson"	0	1	0
125472670805257_409090082443513	"Recently I corresponded with the Delta Skymiles staff via email. Only to receive template emails in return. I have been a Skymiles member since the early 90's. Since that time I have been at least Silver Medallion. When last year I traveled approximately 17k miles I lost status. Which is fine, however Delta chooses not to rollover the accumulated miles. Rollover is a standard term in the consumer marketplace - originated by cell phone companies and typically does not require contingencies. Having been of status I just assumed Delta would have standard practices and roll over the miles because I was a medallion and long time Delta frequent flyer. The response I received was that they would not upgrade me, it is as if they didn't bother to read my email. I was simply asking for a concession. I am dismayed by the questionable practices of Delta, the poor communication and lack of recognition. There are choices in the marketplace and although I truly enjoy Delta, I am left with no choice but to spend my money elsewhere. "	0	1	0

I want it to be well known to everyone, including your own company, what sort of people you hire to work for your Geek Squad.   My Letter to Best Buy:  To Whom it May Concern:  On December 15th, my husband and I drove a total of one hundred miles to take my laptop to the nearest Best Buy in Valdosta, Ga. to have the Geek Squad send it off to the manufacturer as it was still under warranty. I was experiencing problems with all three of my USBs losing connection or losing power. We had been told by a representative over the phone to do this.  When we arrived at the Best Buy, we were directed to an older woman named Georgie or Georgia. We explained the problem to her, and she informed us she would have to duplicate the problem. I began to explain to her that having the laptop laying still on a desk would not duplicate the problem. I only experienced the problem while it was in my lap and being somewhat moved around. That is the purpose of a laptop. She continued to stand there indolently and spoke almost as if she needed a nap or an antidepressant, or perhaps even needed an antidepressant herself telling me repeatedly she could not duplicate the problem. She then repeated herself again stating, ""Well I can't duplicate the problem. Maybe if I open up a program it'll do it.""  At this point, I had to walk away. I was already losing my patience, and I had to leave her with my husband, who simply took it from her to go sit down somewhere and try to duplicate the problem. I find it offensive that someone would make such a remark. My husband has a bachelor's degree in computer science and is a software developer. I, myself, at least have enough common sense to know opening up a program is not going to cause your USBs to lose power or connection. Frankly, I do not expect much from your Geek Squad; however, I do expect a bit more. I expect someone to at least not blatantly show such an aversion to doing anything more than moving around a mouse lazily. I also expect someone to sound as if they are somewhat awake.  Furthermore, I am the customer. Shouldn't I be right? I cannot control when my laptop has problems. I only know that I have the problems regularly. On top of this, I bought a warranty just in case, but now I've been sent home with a laptop I cannot trust to work consistently. My husband will be calling the manufacturer to see if we can get around this problem, but if we can't, again, I'm stuck with a computer that is less than a year old that has problems that your company's indolent employee cannot be bothered to do anything more with than move a mouse around. Again, like I said, I don't expect much, but I expected more than this.  Sincerely,  Holly Lee"	0	1	0

I went back today, the first time all week i had enough time, to be told by the manager i needed to bring the milk with me to get a refund.  Really?!!?  I am not loading an open gallon of spoiled milk into my car let alone keep it in my house till I can get back to Rite Aid.   I am very disappointed with this answer, let alone the fact that i amazing time taking 2 kids to the local Gas station so they could have breakfast.  She told me I should of called her Sunday and she would of marked it down what is the difference of me telling her on Sunday or coming into the store?

125472670805257_517439231608597	"I posted this on Tuesday, November 20th around 3:15pm and never heard a response from anyone...what a suprise. I have again tried phone and email support and have gotten nowhere! And just to think I'm about to fly 19,000 miles with Delta in the next two weeks! Here is my previous post... As a Diamond Medallion Member I feel the need to express by disappointment and concern through this post since talking with Delta Representatives both in person and on the phone has resulted in nothing but empty apologies and no action. I'm hoping maybe through this post I'll receive a more gratifying outcome before switching my loyalty elsewhere. I traveled from MCO to IAD on Monday, November 5th. When I collected my luggage from baggage claim at IAD I noticed the locked zippers were unlocked, the fabric portion of the zipper was torn, and I was missing items out of my luggage. Before leaving MCO my luggage was in good condition with no issues, and yes, I do check it regularly since I fly 2-4 times a week. I proceeded to the Delta baggage claim office at IAD to explain the problem and get some resolution...as I started talking I was interrupted by the lady at the counter who told me to ""Read the sign, read the sign!"" After reading the sign about  normal wear and tear not being covered I explained the problem in detail as it wasn't normal wear to my luggage. She filled out a claim ticket and said I would need to follow-up with the Diamond Desk which I thought seemed quite odd. She offered no more help. The following morning I contacted the Diamond Desk to explain the situation and of course, they couldn't help. I was then transferred to Guest Assistance and explained the problem for a third time now and while the gentlemen was nice and polite, he was also no help and said the baggage claim desk at IAD were the only ones who could help me. He offered to place 7500 miles into my account for all the inconvenience. I thanked him yet have never received the courtesy points he offered. I tried multiple times on the phone with different departments and have gotten nowhere so now I'm out a $500 piece of luggage, two dress shirts, and still missing the courtesy points that were promised. So my question becomes...why in the world would I want to continue my loyalty to Delta if this is the result of all the miles traveled and money spent? Any help would be appreciated."	0	1	0

At 7:30 they said that they had checked the voicemail but it was going to be an hour. At 8:30 I was told that it was going to be another half an hour because they hadn't filled it yet, then at 9 I was told that they were waiting for the pharmacist to review it and it was going to be another 20 minutes. So at 9:20 I go back and they asked if I wanted it flavored because the medicine didn't taste good at all and I said yes, well, that took another 5 minutes. 9:25 I paid and told them that I would be calling the manager AND corporate office tomorrow to file a complaint about how long it took. It should NOT take 3 hours to get a little bottle of medicine. He just looked at me and said ""Um, sorry?"" and shrugged then walked away."	0	1	0

Best Buy already placed their order and are now waiting on Samsung to fill these orders. We are going on 3 months since the purchase date of the Samsung phone. Best Buy hasnt had the best customer service either. Multiple calls to best buy in the last few months and multiple hang ups ... on us the customer. Last night, I was finally able to at the very least get a $50 gift card offer from Best Buy for all our trouble and to remain on the waiting list. SAMSUNG ... we love your products and would love to continue doing business with you, but not if this is how you do business. Samsung creates the Promotion ... Samsung ask Best Buy to run this promotion & now they are making Best Buy look bad as well as themselves.

Upon arriving in Denver our flight encountered a maintenance issue and a part had to be flown in to replace it, I got on the reservation line and switched to the next flight 90 minutes later, no problem. Once we were getting ready to board this flight developed a maintenance issue. (5 of my last 9 flight has had this problem, I want safe aircraft of course but maybe Jeff $mi$ek could have taken a little less of a raise and spent a few bucks on preventive maintenance). So all in all I get home 4 hours later than planned and now stuck in Chicago rush hour. I call customer care (at United?) and when I informed them I feel that I should be compensated in some way they offer me a $25 coupon off my next flight! So I have accumulated nearly a million miles flying with this carrier, been a 1K flier for years and my worth to them amounts to $6.25/hour, not even minimum wage.

My guess is that you were required to fire him due to some insurance policy and the threat that it would be cancelled if you don't terminate violators of this company policy. You probably have a PR team telling you right now to just hang in there and it'll all go away eventually.  They're probably saying ""don't respond, it'll just encourage more people to attack you"".  If you HAD to fire him for a reason like this, maybe you should explain that to the public and then reward Devin with a nice fat check for stopping a possible robbery / murder.

There is absolutely NO way I will be shopping at CVS 2 times in ONE week. I'm sure MANY other customers would readily agree with me. I'm very disappointed with this and I really hope that it does not last. I may actually contact many of my friends and tell them to refrain from shopping at CVS until you change back to the normal WEEKLY ad. Most people don't have time to deal with 2 different sale ads in one week. Also, we (most shoppers) do NOT purchase CVS brand items. I would greatly appreciate your consideration to what I've noted in this post. Thanks."	0	1	0

I held my tongue all three times it has happened. I even tolerated you forgetting to order medication four times, and lying about my insurance. What I cannot tolerate is you giving my 6 year old the wrong medication --- giving him the adult version, which is TWICE the MG he is supposed to be taking. Then saying, OOPS, they look a lot alike. Or, mislabeling not one, but BOTH of his inhalers for his VERY serious asthma. You are putting his health and life at risk. I wonder how many others have failed to catch your mistakes?? Luckily, I check and double check his RX's. Thankfully the Rite Aid the next town over ACTUALLY knows what they are doing, because the one in Cowpens, SC should be shutdown before they kill someone!!!!!  Thanks,  A VERY Concerned Mommy PS) I called and spoke with someone earlier, but as a warning to other parents or those with elderly relatives, CHECK the labels and the medications, ESPECIALLY if you use the pharmacy in Cowpens!"	0	1	0
159616034235_10150783223244236	I Want to let everyone know they should NEVER about the horrible way that I have been treated by not only by the local Walmart but by the VIP line and every other person I have spoken with! I was given gift cards as a gift after my son was born....when I went to use them I discovered they had already been used. When we started investigating we discovered that they had been used on line to buy stuff and shipped to California not to Texas (where I live). The customer service has been AWFUL and there is not one person that has helped me. I will make sure that I tell everyone and I will never step foot into another Walmart!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!	0	1	0

As well as the daughter in law of a long time Kroger employee Paula Ritter. But today I was so proud of the employees and the managers at the Kroger that I shop at, I had to leave after witnessing this because I just couldn't hold back the tears. I am a 911 dispatcher for Cobb County Georgia. Everyday I answer phones and dispatch our police and firemen to emergency situations, many being life and death! So for me to be able to witness my local firefighters being thanked just meant so much, especially on a day of rememberance like today! September 11, 2001 changed my life forever in many ways, and this act of kindness helped me put today's grief into perspective! The following is what I posted on facebook page as soon as I got home from your store on Macland Road in Powder Spring, GA.   Fate stepped in on my way home from taking Laine to school! I had decided I wasn't going to stop at the store till this afternoon, but I decided last minute to go ahead and stop on the way back. While I wa there they made an announcement over the PA for ALL store employees to come to the floral department immediatley! I was near that area so I walked that way too curious what they were doing. I he...ard the manager telling the employees that ""our local firefighters"" are in the store and we have a couple of gift baskets for them to thank them for their service in honor of 9/11. A few minutes late 2 of the guys from the local station walked to the front after being called over the PA to come to the front! The manager and all the employees gave them the gift baskets and thanked them for all their service. I guess GOD wanted me there to withness this first hand, I had to leave the store immediately because I just couldn't hold back the tears! ONE NATION UNDER GOD, I will NEVER FORGET!!   Thank you!!!"	1	0	0

With proof that more than enough money was in my checking account AND two other savings accounts to cover an automatic withdrawl that comes out of my main checking account weekly, of which I attempted to transfer funds to cover that withdrawl over 6 times last week and it continued to tell me ' Your request is not allowed' - I called and spoke to a supervisor whom assured me the funds were transfered. I looked into my account today and noticed that my savings account was negative $33.00. It's funny that I am being charged for an overdraft fee for a payment that was NEVER paid and promised funds were transfered to. This isn't the first time, Last Summer I had a passing in the family and called to stop payment on a $2,000.00 plane ticket to purchase a closer dated ticket, was AGAIN promised funds would not go through. Of which a week later, they did. Leaving me short of $2,000.00. (Which nothing was done to resolve my issue and no empathy was given from this 'professional' corporation. Today I spoke with a rep that transfered me to a supervisor without it being requested. The supervisor was extremely unprofessional and showed no concern and when I mentioned possibly closing all four accounts, she specifically said, ""Ma'am, I feel that would be a GREAT idea! Is there anything else I may help you with today?"" I cannot believe the way this company conducts customer service! They succeed on charging customers fees for their mistakes, and need to improve the training of their customer service representatives! Maybe if they knew how to perform their job better, proper procedures would be followed instead of assuring their customers false information! We as customers depend on this company to hold our money, to pay our bills to survive, feed our children and it's treated as if it's no big deal. I want something done about this company, I am FINISHED with Bank of America and would NEVER recommend them to anyone! I now see why I was told ""DO NOT bank with them!"" Maybe I should have listened. I am so thankful that I realized what a fraudulent service you provide before it took what my family depends on to live. It's too bad other customer's didn't realize it before your multi-million dollar company landed them and their families on the streets. Go Bank of America, You're #1!! "	0	1	0

We bought a comforter for our room a week ago, and since then have bought/decorated to match accordingly, only to wake up this morning to an e-mail saying that our order has been cancelled and the product is out of stock. The product was not out of stock when I ordered it. That is why I ordered it and decorated my home around it. And now I am left with a decorated room and no comforter. For Target to disregard our order for a week, then cancel it is UNACCEPTABLE. For Target to market a product on their website as ""in stock"" when it's really not IS UNACCEPTABLE. And the most unacceptable thing is that this is the second time this year this has happened. And still this corporation doesn't care. I now realize that Target has absolutely zero care for its customers, and zero care for their customer satisfaction, traits that were not apparent when we used to work there.

92979593115_10150695733073116	" Below is my post to the CVS page earlier this week I also sent it to  the VP Corp Communications, Carolyn Castel  401-770-5717  CCastel@cvs.com and SVP Corp Communications & Community Relations, Eileen Howard-Dunn 401-770-4561  ehdunn@cvs.com however my email did not warrant a reply as they forwarded on to the ""Customer Relations Team"" who in turn completed distorted the issue.  Another great job at CVS:  I go to pick up my prints last night and something told me to look at them first.  I opened the envelope in which the pictures were ""shoved"" in and saw they were printed shoddily.  It appears one of their ""Photo Technicians"" cut the negatives incorrectly and negative 1 became a picture ""half of negative 1 and half of negative 2"".  This trend continued half way through my roll.  Luckily, the pictures that were destroyed were not that important to me. There were others on the roll that were cut correctly and came out great (at least the ones I took). I was originally upset however I thought maybe the CVS disposable camera I used was imperfect.  The new store manager came over and he was apologetic and helpful.  When you looked at the negative, you didn't see anything wrong so he said - ""I will print up a new set for you"".  Okay, today I get a call and it's CVS.  ""Mr. Restmeyer, we were unable to reprint your pictures, the negatives are damaged"".  Since we can't reprint the pictures, I can compensate you with a new disposable camera"".  Great, I say, let me get the group together that I took the pictures of and go back in time.  I told her I don't have time for this right now but I will be in later today for a FULL REFUND.  What really gets me the most is the ""Photo Technician"" didn't note the envelope and just let me pay my $17.00 (I got triples).  I doesn't matter what CVS I go to and whoever I'm with, there is always something.  It could be in Manhattan or my local stores - either the sale doesn't ring up correctly or something happens at the picture station.   Last week, the 3 for $3.00 cards rang up $3.87 (1.29 each) - how many people did they get over on with this deal.  This week, buy $20.00 in Hallmark Cards, get 5 Extra Bucks.  I buy four cards last night, only two go towards the reward.  Let me give credit where credit is due - the store manager asked me for my card and printed the 5 Extra Bucks for me right on the spot - I do commend him on that however to shop in your stores is a very difficult experience when you are trying to save money.  Either the cashier is annoyed with you and your coupons/separate orders or something scans incorrectly and now I need to go get the sign/show them the advertised price in the circular.  I love ""MY CVS"" mainly because of convenience factor (closest in proximity to my home) and the Extra Bucks Program however the stores themselves and the employees in general leave a negative impression on the shopping experience.

92979593115_10150700296733116	"I am posting this tonight because I feel I have to. I switched to using CVS Pharmacy in January 2012 because I was forced to when Walgreens stopped accepting Express Scripts insurance. I chose CVS because they are located close to my home and also a 24 hour pharmacy ( A quality I greatly value in a pharmacy). I must say I have been consistently getting bad service from CVS since then. I have filled prescriptions at 3 different CVS locations since January and the service has always been unpleasant. Last night was by far the worst. I went into the store to pick up a prescription for myself and my child. When the prescription was filled by the pharmacist they failed to run it through the available insurance coverage. When I refused to pay the price that rang up and asked that it be ran through the insurance, the cashier yelled at me and told me to take a seat because this was going to take her awhile. Something that actually only took maybe 2 minutes max by the way.  When she returned and then yelled at me to return to the register, she then lectured me on making sure I inform them of the coverage we have(that is on file ) when calling in refills or dropping  off prescriptions so that this does not occur again. As if the mistake was all my fault in the first place.The store was not busy. I was 1 of 2 customers at the pharmacy counter. I am saddened that I am clearly not a valuable CVS customer like I was at Walgreens. I have a disabled son who takes 11 different medications. I take our pharmacy care very seriously. After reading other stories here I see I am not alone. I believe next month we will be switching pharmacies again."	0	1	0

Customer service does clearly not mean anything to your company which is why Best Buy will not be around in several years. For example tonight, I went in 30 minutes before your store closed to buy a new iPhone and was turned away because I came too late...I was going to spent about $400 in your store but your employees were more worried about getting out on time than helping a customer. I left and tried to call the manager to express my frustrations and spent literally 15 minutes (I am NOT exaggerating this) listening to the phone ring while no one answered my call. I then tried to call customer care but their office closes early, and then I can't find anywhere on your website to file a complaint which means you don't want to hear what your customers have to say! This makes no sense to me because Best Buy is in direct competition with several other companies in every product you offer. You compete with Apple, AT&T, Verizon, Home Depot, Lowe's, Target, Walmart, Game Stop, Radio Shack, Sears, Amazon, etc....however you provide the crappiest customer service of all of them!!

It seemingly is consistently and constantly understaffed with cashiers during the peak business, which causes unduly wait times for customers to pay for their purchases. It is sad, really.

You know what was bought, when it was bought, how much, and in many cases (due to the Safeway Club Card), who buys it.

It's not just the customers that suffer.  Your employees suffer too. I've talked to them.  They see and understand the problem.  There are some great employees there.

I'm completely irritated in the fact that I was told this is to ""ensure the funds are there"", after waiting on hold for 10 minutes on my FIFTH attempt to get ahold of somebody (other 4 times Bank of America's automated system dropped my calls at various points, including after 15 minutes of waiting). After wasting my day off trying to simply close my account I've decided ultimately I'm done with this bank, in every aspect. Any future account that has any ties to Bank of America will be closed on the spot.   The check in question comes from a trust account, to pay my monthly bills, to this one simply to use my BofA debit card. It was a bank issued cashier's check, from the counter, as their policy does not allow cash in the amount that I had ordered. I have over 60x the amount of the cashier's check in this other bank between all of my accounts in this bank.  Because of this hold, I will miss all of my bills for this month, and have to struggle to pay for $4.00/gal or higher gas to commute to college with. So thanks for bending me over!  I encourage other people elsewhere to search other banks. A lot of them now are offering better services than B of A (ATM fee refunds, etc) for free. If you're reading this and are unhappy, switch. There's a reason why I've seen them struggling in the news, this is why.  And they actually care about their customers.  I thank Bank of America for 5 years of good service and 1 of absolute hell.  Thanks, Matt Menghi"	0	1	0

I am a real estate broker and based on our personal experience, I will never be able to refer business to Wells Fargo.  It was soap opera drama right up to the closing.  The closing was 10 days past our contract to close date on the P&S contract.  Loan process started out good but became clear that the loan officer, processer, and U/W had no idea what they were doing.  They had the paperwork forever, but never bothered to read it.  After getting two supervisors involved, who also did not read the documents until we basically read them with them on the phone, we did get some assistance getting this done.  Right down to the end, Wells Fargo basically re-wrote our agreement with the seller's and the HUD statement was wrong, but WF would not re-write the HUD or our documents so the sellers in our transaction actually were able to pay US less than what our contract agreement stated.  How is that for a nice bonus!!! We were wronged by $2093 thanks to Wells Fargo - were totally STRESSED out with their repetative delays - and lack of knowledge.  It was absolutely horrid.  Unfortunately to date, Wells Fargo has not reached out to make us whole or bothered to make us feel any better about things.  It is really really really upsetting.  "	0	1	0

12699262021_10150507373057022	"Yesterday, at your Best Buy Mobile location in Square One shopping mall in Mississauga Ontario, I had THE WORST CUSTOMER SERVICE EXPERIENCE OF MY LIFE!!!!! Here's what happened...we went to buy iPhones at Best Buy because I had a $250 gift card for there. The first words out of my mouth to the guy were ""We want to buy iPhones with our Best Buy gift cards"" (this was also mentioned several times throughout the process). He stated ""No problem,"" sat us down and started the process. His first question was what colour - we wanted black. After checking, he said they only had white available, to which we replied that we'd simply go to another Best Buy. Amazingly, he was then able to find black ones. I guess they were pushing white ones - maybe they weren't selling as well. Then he pulled up our Rogers account to make sure we qualified for an upgrade (which we did). I placed the gift card on the table right under his nose, as my method of payment (or at least partial). Long-story-short, after sitting there for an hour while he processed the deal, another couple came who were waiting for him. Despite their claim of ""no commission"", he was extremely anxious to pass us off to another guy to complete the activation so he could then grab these guys. His co-worker replied, ""Tell them I can take care of them"". He insisted that he wanted to take care of them, to which his co-worker replied, ""That's not how we work here - we're supposed to be a team"". So he was stuck with us. Long-story-short, when he started handing us the phones, it seemed like the transaction was over. Of course, he gave an extremely heavy sales pitch on the extended warranty, to which we had to decline about 6 times (I call bullshit on no commission - it may not be commission, but they are being incented for sure). I then asked what the total was, and he simply would not give a straight answer. He said there was no need to pay today, and that the charges would be on my next bill. I replied that I still wanted to pay today so I could use my Best Buy card, and again he evaded the question.... don't worry, no need to pay today. This went on and on, and I eventually replied that obviously Rogers isn't going to accept my Best Buy card, thus I wanted to pay today. After another few minutes of him evading a direct answer, he eventually admitted that he was not able to take my Best Buy card as payment. Apparantly this is indeed true, but the fact is that he knew along, as it was mentioned several times, that I wished to pay using my gift card. Instead of being upfront and informing me that this was not possible, he intentionally and blatantly mislead me into believing this was no problem. I guess he thought that after sitting there for an hour, that I would proceed anyways. Needless to say, Joanne and I both lost it. I cannot stress (you really had to be there) how blatant and intentional he was in misleading us. When the manager came over (as we were creating a bit of a scene to say the least), he basically accused us of lying, saying that he did tell us. The manager then took over, we demanded that she reverse everything, and after about another half hour we were out of there with everything reversed. Again, there is no doubt that this was blatant and intentional misleading by this salesman. The sad part is, we then went and bought them from Rogers - in other words, if he told me right from the getgo that I couldn't use the gift card, I still would've bought. Absoultley astounded by his unscrupulous behavior. I'll never go there again."	0	1	0

125472670805257_452835688068952	"in two hours I was supposed to leave for the airport to pick up my family that is visiting from the US, but thanks to Deltas discrimination and Racism that isnt going to happen. They were supposed to leave at 7:00 a.m EST from Greensboro, NC to Atlanta, and from ATL to San Jos, Costa Rica. My fathers passport is expired, but he has valid ID from Costa Rica, and guess what he is Costa Rican and he is flying to his HOME country. But the lady at the airport didnt let him fly because of the expired passport, with no knowledge that he could fly with only a valid ID to his home country. My family offered solutions like letting them to fly to ATL to solve the situation there, also the consulate of CR is in that city. But she was negative about it. She also said that it was US law to not let him leave, and that was the way things were done in AMERICA (like there were not other 35 countries in AMERICA), which i consider is a very xenophobic comment. This things are governed by international law not the one from the US. And if she was so concerned, she should have consulted(and actually have knowledge) of international law regarding traveling. That is why I think you should train your crew a little better. Finally, after calling Delta, this lady realized her mistake so she let them leave, but the flight was already gone. So, now they are flying at 11 p.m and arriving at CR at 6:30 local time, when they were supposed to do so at 12 p.m local time. I had planned a great afternoon for them, since we had a lot of time without seeing each other, but thanks to Deltas discrimination and xenophobia (I understand its just one person, but she represents your company) the plans are gone. Thank you for nothing! If you read this message be warned that Delta is discriminatory and racist."	0	1	0

I was supposed to be in Florida this past weekend, and though I was checked in to my flight, my seat was given to someone on standby. I was at the gate when the sign still said boarding, and the reason I was bumped from my flight appears to be a staff error on your end. I ended up missing a very important weekend, and though your staff says you can't put a price on the experience I missed, I am not happy with the contact I have had with Delta (two form emails saying the situation is closed). I would really appreciate someone contacting me by phone. I've been a Skymiles member for 4 years, and as of right now, I have no reason to ever fly with Delta again.

Well late last week when the US had that line of storms that moved through the house was narrowly struck by lightning; hit the power pole for us and followed the old copper coaxial cable from the cable company (they went to fiber optic). It managed to blow out our cable box mounted on the outside; no damage just found pieces throughout the yard. It did manage to follow the internet line into the house and fried the surge protector, router and the main computer (desktop); fried the mother board. Unfortunately I have been lazy in the last few months and guess who hasn't done a recent back up??? Good guess, you is a smart cookie!!   Took the computer to Best Buy (I had recently renewed their Geek Squad program for another 3 years; only choice they gave me) and they will fix everything for free. I got an email later that day to provide a link to track my  repairs. Heck you would not believe the folder and paper work trail they create to track what happens. I got a couple of glances at it and I could tell you who did what, what time they did it, and lastly what were the results.   They do get you on the ""additional services"". I can hand them a lump of plastic and if they can't fix they will replace but any data backup is an additional service. Okay, I can deal with that (if I HAD BACKED UP) so I will fork over the cash to pay for my mistake. Problem was the hard drive was not cooperating but they kept with it. Just picked up my copy of the back up and can I just say. Oh boy is I happy. 3 months of lost records isn't much but I back up everything, transfer paper to digits, etc it adds up.   So I may not be able to get sales help on the floor (I have given up trying to critique them with their cooperate offices, it doesn't help; apathetic sales reps led by a managers that are clueless on how to lead, mentor or even counsel is never going to get better) but I will wax eloquent about their customer service/Geek Squad services."	0	1	0

199504650087085_340732732630942	"Dear United Airlines Customer Service Management,  I am writing you to offer you some insight about my experience on the airline on March 11-12, 2012.  UA 1548 Miami-Houston was delayed about 2 hours.  Thank you for the snacks while I waited for the plane to arrive.  However, will you please consider also offering snack options like Kraft cheese and crackers, peanut butter and saltines and carrots?  In addition, I'm a fan of Coke products, but you don't offer Dasani.  I find water and healthier snacks to be better for me in a stressful situation.   Airlines created this situation of longer boarding times when they started charging for bags.  I find it incongruent when I hear PA announcements from gate agents asking passengers to come forward to check their bags at no charge so that boarding the plane can happen more quickly.  Why would I give up my bag when I know I might miss my connecting flight?  If you are not already aware, there is also passenger perception that United has a problem with losing luggage.  Your employees actually have told me this too.  I know when my new arrival time in Houston is 20 minutes after my connecting flight is scheduled to depart that I can expect additional challenges at my connecting airport, and that was the case.  I believe most of the passengers on my plane missed their connecting flights.    So here it goes.  There was no agent at the gate to direct me to the nearest customer service assistance center.  That annoyed me since it was my first time at the Houston airport and your flight crew said there would be an agent.  I've have always felt there should be an international symbol for Customer Service,  and have the symbol be visible from any direction at customer service stations.   The line at Customer Service was at least 60 people long so I had time to observe the reticketing experience for many passengers and I offer these suggestions.  It can take up to two hours to talk to an agent for a group of this size.  Some chairs would be nice for the elderly.  I think the elderly and families with children should be served first.  Being delayed is stressful for everyone especially on kids.  It seems to me a good idea to offer snacks like you did in the originating city.  Food has a way of calming nerves.  Nobody really wants to leave their place in line for anything unless it's the bathroom.    My reticketing experience started with the agent telling me United can get me to Denver on March 13.  Really.  To me, customer service starts with greeting the individual, acknowledging the situation including the severity and length of time of the weather event and its associated impact across the airline system, and a promise to get you home. Options are also nice.   Inexperienced travelers will react about delays as they will react.  More experienced travelers will hear the agent and internally adjust their attitude.  Even though the agent made me feel more anxiety by announcing to me my one solution before she established some rapport with me, I did appreciate her service.  She worked hard to find a return flight for me on March 12.  It turned out to be the same flight that I was scheduled on March 11.  At 12:30am I decided to look into getting a hotel room.  It was very unpleasant to hear that shuttle service to an available hotel room was discontinued at 11:30 pm.  Perhaps you can work with your hotel partners to address this situation.  Nobody really wants to pay cab fare on top of a hotel room in this situation.  I went back to UA ticketing at 1:00am to see if my return trip time could be improved.  The agent found a seat on a flight at 7:00pm and changed my ticket.  I liked that a lot.    Please consider a page in Hemisphere magazine that explains your commitment to your customers when they experience delays in travel by weather or mechanical, and what they can expect from the airline in each situation.    I got home on March 12 in the morning by presenting myself at the ticket counter at 4:30am to request standby.

I call the manager of the store and he says ""we made the mistake we will fix it, just bring them in to the store and we will take them back and give you two new female hamsters.""  I actually take the damn things to the store and I am told by the night manager that they can't take them back and that there was no way the hamsters I got from them were anything but females because they are an all female store.  With that said those 2 'Females' they sold me had babies in the first 7 days of ownership.  So much for all female store and making their mistake right.  The workers couldn't even tell whether the damn things were male or female and that is their line of business.  With that said I have 5 dogs and a chinchilla and I am no longer shoping at PetSmart.  I have done business with them faithfully for many years, NOT ANYMORE!!! I will go to the local pet store where they know how to really take care of their customers!!!!"	0	1	0

I asked the ""greeter"" for assistance locating a movie their website said was in the store and which I intended to buy but she thought handing out ads and saying welcome to incoming customers was more important  I went to another department but couldn't find anyone to help me; I may have to return the 2 items I bought if they aren't compatible with a device we already own.  Finally, the cashier didn't know what to do when my Best Buy card required a call for verification.   I have very little on my card, far from being over the limit.  I purchased an iPad a few weeks ago and today's purchase was only $100.   ""Chelsie"" the manager wasn't helpful either.   I still don't know why I got the 3rd degree or why it took so long.      With this amount of hassle, I'll check out other consumer electronics stores.... In the past few years I've purchased and paid off 3 laptops plus other devices.   They must not want my business."	0	1	0

I was asked to leave with my service dog, wearing her vest, disturbing no one. I was so a) embarrassed b) so mad I had gone out of my way yet again to have myself and my 8 pound service dog asked to leave. Someone needs to educate their staff on federal laws concerning this.

I will, however, say that the store manager was very angry about having to come up to the front of the store to wait on a few other customers while the cashier rang up my 3 transactions.  (just strange, because he was out on the floor staring at every move i made until he saw me head to the register.) long story short.. he told me i needed to ""stop running my mouth."" i am very aggrivated by this and will continue to post these types of posts about your employees and keep calling the customer service number until i get an apology from the store man. himself  AND compensation for my couponing time, as i was downgraded and made to feel like less of a person.

When did it become okay for a business to tear someone away from their families in hope to make a profit? I come home twice a year from school for holidays. Both times I have come home, he has been working at your God forsaken store and not spending time with loved ones. I look forward every year to spending time with my family on holidays, but now I cant because he is stuck at this store. I cant even express how wrong that is for me to feel. Christmas is about being with family and enjoying the time you have with them not slaving over a store where NO ONE is going to be in BECAUSE THEY ARE SPENDING TIME WITH THEIR FAMILIES.  It would be one thing if the Pharmacy was open, but it is not; so why bother keeping someone there if nothing is going to get done anyway?

We found a ticket for $306 (before $21.60 taxes and fees) and went to book the flight. MAGICALLY the price of the flight went up $128 dollars to $434. I couldn't believe it and figured that the price included both the regular fare and the companion fare... but no- the extra $128 dollars is the fee that I have to pay for the ""privilege"" of using my companion fare? I thought this was part of the reason I paid my annual fee on my credit card. The supervisor I spoke with had nothing to tell me except she was sorry I was frustrated and it is all outlined in the fine print on Delta.com. (And when I tried to compare it to using a coupon at a restaurant, and for the privilege of using the coupon, the full price meal went up by 25% she said she wouldn't continue the conversation because it was TOTALLY different - maybe they forgot to put it in the fine print???) Going onto Delta.com I found: Companion certificate is valid for one round-trip First-Class or Economy Class companion ticket with the purchase of certain adult round-trip fares on published routings within the 48 contiguous United States."" I guess the word I was supposed to notice was ""certain"" which is such a great term to cover any restriction - or in this case - extreme price hike that Delta wants to impose! This is such SO disappointing and absolutely and blatantly misleading.  I would love to find out from someone at Delta the rationale (or excuse) for this but am not sure there really is a good explanation, other than this being another way to sneak in a few hundred dollars more in fees. Has anyone else had this same experience?? "	0	1	0

152789358067261_374469292565932	"Dear Wells Fargo.  Approximately 3 years I went through the process of obtaining a secured credit card with your bank.  The person that took care of me during that process was a branch manager named Derik from the Grant Rd and Dodge Blvd brach in Tucson AZ.  At that time I obviously had questions about building my credit and most were answered.  I asked Derik what the requirements are for graduating to unsecured status.  He informed me that after 12 months the account would be due for review and if I don't have any late payments and if I don't ever exceed the credit limit, my card would be converted to unsecured and my initial deposit would be paid back to me with interest.  That was 3 years ago.  During the last two years I have called the Wells Fargo credit number multiple times (including today) and not even one time have I been able to get any straight answers from any of the customer service reps and their supervisors.  Every time I talk to someone I am told that there's something on my account that prevents me from being graduated.  When I ask for specific information to explain that statement, I get the runaround.  After the runaround round of answers is over then begins the part of telling me about credit reform, current credit regulations, and possible graduation dates coming up.  For some strange reason they all tell me the same things every time.  It's like listening to someone read the same script over and over.  I explain to them that I've complied with every thing that I was told to do to graduate the account.  They tell me that ""yes you've never gone over limit and all your payments are on time but we're not graduating at this time"".  I would really like for someone to contact me about this matter.  I believe that I've worked hard to restore my good standing in the credit community and deserve better from a customer service team that hasn't provided me with REAL customer service in 2 years.  I say this because I believe when a customer calls with questions about his/hers account, they shouldn't be given the runaround for any lenght of time and questions should be answered in a way that doesn't leave the customer wondering ""what just happend?""   Looking forward to hearing from you.  Thank you."	0	1	0

I have almost entirely booked my flights on Continental for the last several years, because of exemplary customer service and (relatively) decent treatment of musicians and our instruments, and, most especially, a flying program that had a generous baggage allowance.  Since the merger with United, the changes to the Silver Elite level are disappointing to say the least.  But - though i can live just fine without complimentary upgrades and early access to economy plus seats -  the loss of a complimentary second bag on international flights is so unacceptable as to be a dealbreaker - as I fly back and forth to Europe several times a year, sometimes as many as 20 - and my guitar must be checked along with my suitcase.    You may think that the 30k-40k flier is not worth your time, attention, or perks.  But I don't book just for me.  I book, or buy for my band and crew as well.

This property is scheduled for foreclosure tomorrow.I am confident you will make this a priority.I spent over 3 hours on the phone Friday (BOA told me I couldn't request a postponement until 48 hours before the scheduled sale I was trying to reach someone who could help me get the request in to postpone. I was transferred from the Short Sale Department to the Foreclosure Department and back again, I was put on hold, talked to supervisors, disconnected (3 times) and never got the help I needed. In at least two instances, the staff could not locate the third party release form-I have been representing my client for over a month. Customer care does not have the latest updates from Equator- they are least 4 days behind. My client has done everything she has been asked her to do from Bank of America including putting the house on the market as a short sale. We are under contract at an excellent price for this area and market with a qualified owner occupant buyer set to close this month. There is NO reason for this property to go into foreclosure. I'm sure this is an oversight.  By the way, I am back in the cycle of being transferred around with customer care as I write this."	0	1	0

This leads me to believe and assume that American Airlines discriminates against all potential passengers. I hope you will not allow this to happen in the future, but that you make a public apology, as well as offer this family a true reimbursement for all they have had to endure. I can only imagine the challenges of traveling with a special needs child, so to add further time or complications to their trip is truly cruel.

163478290365055_467908456588702	"Retailers are a curious breed. Given a choice, they would rather deal with a dead employee, than a dead criminal.  You see, if an employee is killed by a criminal, they can throw some money at the dead employees family and make them go away. They can also fake sympathy for the dead employee, and grab some free publicity because they think everyone will feel sorry for Autozone and support them by shopping there.  If on the other hand, a violent criminal is killed in the comission of a crime, they may have to deal with litigation from the dead criminals family because a representative of Autozone killed them.   So to bottom line it, in the long run it's cheaper for an employee to die in a robbery, then it is for the criminal. Since Autozone is all about making a profit, it makes good business sense.  So what do you do to change this mindset. You simply effect their bottom line. It isn't enough for one or two people to boycott an Autozone store, they will still make a profit. You have to get everyone around you to boycott a store. A store has to spend more money to keep the lights on then they are taking in, and it has to effect those at the corporate level. If you don't do that, they won't care. That's the mentality of a retailer."	0	1	0

My 7 & 8 year old sons asked Santa for the Wii U this Christmas, they are the most well behaved kids so of course Santa should be bringing them the #1 thing on their lists... I tried pre-ordering the Wii U console on the Gamestop website release date and was having problems. You were supposed to be able to reserve the console with just $50, but every time I added to cart and started the checkout for the black Wii U console it would ask me for the full amount of $399 + taxes. I emailed Gamestop immediately and after a few days I got an email reply that wasn't helpful at all then I returned to the site to find the console was sold out... I stopped by one of the Gamestop stores and was told that they will not have the console available to purchase without a pre-order until November 2013!!!! I have always been a dedicated Gamestop customer, but after this disappointment I just can't I will not spend my money at Gamestop anymore.

117497138610_10151222142873611	"I want to express my sincere appreciation for a Walgreen's employee.  My 9 year old daughter wanted to purchase something for me today for Christmas, (I think it was nail polish or something) and I knew she had money and she told me she had enough left.  I hung close by about 15-20 feet away from the register, (just enough so she wouldn't notice) with my 7 year old daughter.  It seemed to be taking a little longer than normal and I asked my youngest to run up and ask her if she needed more money, she politely declined.  However, it seemed like she must have been digging for some money and wasn't coming up with it.  I started to notice the young male cashier, who was possibly just out of high school, reaching into his back pocket and seemed like he was reaching for his wallet.  I caught his eye and said ""Does she need money, because I can come help pay for it?""  He politely declined and told me ""No, I got it.""  He then took money out of his own wallet and helped my daughter pay for a present for me, without ever letting her know that he was doing it.  Thank you so much for doing one of the most kind and generous things you could have done for another person.  It may have only been a dollar or so, but you have helped a little girl gain a little independence and will be so proud when she gives her present that she purchased without any help from mommy.....And thank you for restoring some of my faith in humanity...With all the evil and sadness experienced in the last 24 hours, it is so heartwarming to truly experience random acts of kindness and love.  I cried when I explained to the people behind my daughter who thought the cashier was her older brother or at least have known her to have done that,  I cried when I went and explained to a manager what he had done, I cried when I told my husband, and I am crying as I write this.  It is amazing how a small act of kindness can mean so much, and I am sure that cashier has no idea how much what he did meant to me or my daughter, but it has touched me beyond words.... Thank you again and store #11174 in Knoxville, TN will forever have my business.  Merry Christmas!"	1	0	0

I bought this as a Christmas gift - I didn't really wait the 48 days, I waited 13 days after he opened the gift. Gee, after working from 8 - 6, I went home to be with my family after work, cooking dinner and having some down time after dealing with broken families at work all day. Yea, shame on me for waiting till I had a day off and shame on me for not reading the entire receipt. BTW, Target is the ONLY retail mangement that has this policy - ONLY one and yes, I will never ever go to Target again - and as I have read from all my friends' emails, they too feel the same say and are passing on this information to their friends.

Allows you to make deposits then charges you $35 to withdraw some of that money.  Allows college kids to get BOA credit cards then signs them up for credit protection but does not make the kid fully aware that "" yeah we cover your overdraft but we transfer min of $100 from your credit card and whacks you with $10 fee to sweep the money to the acct and a cash advance fee"".  My sons credit card was maxxed because of this endless cycle and now he is charged an outrageous interest rate.  Then to make it worse I put my name on his account so when he went to college so I could easily transfer money when he got in a jam.  Thanks to BOA and their opt out overdraft scandal they keep letting him use his debit card but guess what...If in 5 days he doesn't cover it they whack my acct for the money.  But yet when he had a fraud hold on his BOA debit card while in Mexico the money I transferred to get him out of Mexico could not be freed up to cover his check-out expenses because ""while I a joint signer on his checking account I am not one on his debit card""  Who the hell do they think funds the checking acct but ME!  Now in the age of electronic signatures I cannot remove my name unless we are in a branch office.  Yay BOA, I am in NC and he is in CT.  Nope can't just go and remove my name that's to easy.

This was the worst experience I've ever had in a pharmacy in my 48 years on earth. It took three clerks to process a simple prescription and forty minutes of watching clerks yawn and roll their eyes at customers made me want to scream. A lady with a sick infant crying told me she had been sitting there for over an hour and only got frowns and rolling eyes when she ask ""how much longer she was going to have to wait?"" I will never allow my doctor to ever send another prescription for my family to Walgreens. The clerk at the front of the store also over charged my son for his candy as we left the store but I ignored it just to get out of the store.

I don't know who thought that discriminating against a particular kind of customer was a sound business decision, but because of your discrimination against couponers I will not shop with you EVER again! I opted out of your load 2 card feature thinking that meant I was still able to use my up rewards the same day.  I was informed today at my local RA that I was not going to be able to do multiple transactions using said rewards.  I don't get it. You get reimbursed by the manufacturer's for the coupons we redeem in your building.   So I don't understand why you don't want my business. That's what your new policy means to me. Do you really think people have time, gas money, etc to drive to your store daily to redeem the reward we earned the day before?   In this economy those of us using coupons do so as a means to provide for our families.  Shame on you for working against hard-working Americans trying to get by.   I had a whole cart of merchandise and walked out without purchasing a thing. To top it off while I was shopping I had the pleasure of listening to one of your associates complaining about another customer first to another store over the phone, then to another associate and then finally a third time to another associate.  I can only assume they were complaining about me after I left.  But I doubt that you care about your customers at all! "	0	1	0

Or actually keep it on a Friday and start it a week early and diffuse the whole situation?  There are reasons why people like shopping at Target - one of them is that you don't stoop the same abusive policies that Walmart does.

CVS and its agent REBKEE Inc. have plans to construct a new big-box store within the Downtown Charles Town (WV) Historic District, which is listed in the National Register of Historic Places by the National Trust and the National Park Service. Plans call for the demolition of between 5 and 7 historic structures and construction of a store and parking lot that would destroy the streetscape at the town's western gateway. Local citizens are working diligently and quickly to stop these actions from destroying the historic nature of the small downtown area. Suitable sites are available outside the historic district but so far have not been considered.

I have been going back and forth for over 6 months now with BofA regarding a fraudulent charge on a now closed account. Since BofA sided with the merchant, I decided to pay the amount in question and proceed with litigation against the merchant, in efforts of retrieving my money and ridding myself of the headaches with BofA. After the money was paid, I closed the account and opened another one with BofA. I was promised I would never wake up again and see money pulled from one account and placed into another, without my authorization. I understand the right of offset as it is related to having multiple accounts with a bank and owing fees on one of the accounts. However, I do not understand how funds can be transferred from an active account into a closed account, to satisfy a BofA mistake(told several times, it was the banking center's mistake).

After entering all of my payment information I hit the submit button and I was given an error saying ""an unknown error has occured, please try again later"". I was given no indication that the transaction was successful, no confirmation number and no ""thank you for your payment"" screen. The person I spoke to suggested I make a payment over the phone, so I did.   Today I noticed they had charged me twice and overdrafted my checking account.  Their answer to this was that they don't know who was to blame and if I submit a handful of paperwork then they will review my case and if they agree that they are to blame then they will mail me a check for overdraft fees.  This process takes 45 days.   Besides that, just getting the original double payment reversed will take a stack of paperwork faxed to them with a 24-48 hour time period to review the fax and 24-48 hours to reverse the charge. Being unhappy with this answer I asked to speak to a supervisor. The supervisor now has my number and will call me back in 24 to 48 hours, but I was assured that they could do nothing more than what was already stated.  Bank of America's policy when THEY screw up is to make you do all the legwork to fix an issue that they caused.  In the meantime I am left with -$800 in my checking account which means until the screw up is resolved I am unable to pay any bills, buy any food, or put gas in my car.  Bank of America should be ashamed not only for the screw-up that they caused, but also for the way they handled the situation. "	0	1	0

I called Best Buy customer service and was basically told by the online customer service representative that I should be *thanking* her for cancelling the order -- however, the $300.00 that was  so readily *swiped* from my credit card will not be credited back until 3-7 business days via Best Buy policy.

I was helped by a cashier named Mike who has Downs Syndrome and I don't know where to start when it comes to my great experience with him.  He was very friendly, funny, and helpful.  When I went over to get a Starbucks I noticed that every customer he helped also left his cashier station with a huge smile on their faces!  Even though it took him a few extra minutes to bag our items, it was worth it for the personalized and friendly customer service he provided!  I am a Special Education teacher with a specific job of helping my students find jobs after graduation.  It was so great to see your company not only hiring this gentleman but also giving him the chance to work the cash register - not just limiting him as a stocker or ""cart boy.""  He convinced my husband to sign up for a Target Card the next time he stops in and overall just made our entire weekend.  Because I am in this profession, I know the battles and obstacles of finding these individuals work and I want to say thank you.  If you ever hesitate to hire another worker with special needs because he/she might not be as ""fast"" as others, remember this story.  To most people, having a friendly customer service experience far out weighs the cashiers speed.   I teach in Elkhorn, WI and would love to talk with someone at the Lake Geneva, WI target about future work possibilities for one of my students with a disability.

Dick Forrey of the Vietnam Veterans Association wrote.  'Recently we asked the local TARGET store to be a proud  sponsor of the Vietnam Veterans Memorial Wall during our spring recognition event.   We received the following reply from the local TARGET management:   Veterans do not meet our area of giving. We only donate to the arts, social action groups, gay & lesbian causes, and education.'   So I'm thinking, if the Vietnam Veterans Memorial Wall and veterans in general, do not meet their donation criteria, then something is really wrong at this TARGET store. We were  not asking for thousands of dollars, not even hundreds, just a small sponsorship for a memorial remembrance.  As a follow-up, I, E-mailed the TARGET U.S. Corporate Headquarters and their response was the same...  That's their national policy!!!  Then I looked into the company further.. They will not allow the Marines to collect for 'Toys for Tots' at any of their  stores. And during the recent Iraq deployment,they would not allow families of employees who were called up for active duty to continue their insurance coverage while they were on military service.. Then as I dig further,  TARGET is a French-owned corporation.  Now, I'm thinking again..  If TARGET cannot support American (or Canadian) Veterans, then why should my family and I support their stores by spending our hard earned American or Canadian dollars in their stores???  And,  have their profits sent to France .   Without the American and Canadian Vets, where would France be today?  'They, most likely would be speaking German and trading in Deutsch Marks'   Sincerely, Dick Forrey Veterans Helping Veterans  Please send this on to everyone you know  to let Target know  we don't need them either !

I was just given an adult Epipen instead of the prescribed Epipen Jr for my 30 lb. 3 year old daughter.  I'm glad I looked at the box and realized that I was given the wrong prescription.  This could have been a fatal mistake for something intended to prevent possible fatal anaphylaxis.  I called the pharmacy to verify the medication, and indeed I was given the wrong dose of medication.  I understand that mistakes happen, but this sure was a big one!  This is also a reminder to parents to be aware of the medications given to your child.  Mistakes are made by everyone, so don't be afraid to question a medical professional or pharmacist!!"	0	1	0

That being said my husband was SSG Eric Shaw, he was killed in Afghanistan in 2010 for a year past his death I continued to live in our house in TN that is mortgaged by bank of America. I moved out because our family needed more room but kept making the payments on the mortgage loan. When i contacted BOA this past March requesting assistance with the loan and to see if I qualified for any hardship programs they told me they could not speak with me because I'm not an authorized user on the account and the loan is in my deceased husbands name. I have since provided all the paper work that I am required to provide according to the laws of TN and you are still REFUSING to talk to me and are now foreclosing on the house my husband left behind for us to live in or use as we needed to support ourselves. From the bottom of my heart I would like to thank you for dragging things out, wasting time and taking the house out from under me anyway.

I want to visit my family and friends in Tennessee over the Christmas holidays, but for the life of me, NO BODY seems to be able to help me. One of my issues happens to be that I live in Hawaii, and this state has some very stringent laws regarding importing pets, which makes my ten pound Shih Tzu Enemy Number One. Instead of an ally in United Air, I have found only additional hostilities. Your ""Pets Fly Safe"" department tells me I need to change my current reservation and to call the reservations department.  Your reservations department can't seem to tell if certain flights allow pets in the cargo hold, so they directed me to ""Pets Fly Safe."" On day number three of Operation Shih Tzu, the fellow at ""Pets Fly Safe"" is able to book my dog a cargo flight into Nashville, but she has to arrive two days later, causing me to pay an extra $100 in kennel fees. I can live with that. However, when trying to book a return flight, I was asked if I wanted her to fly out of New Orleans or Atlanta. Apparently, once my dog gets to Nashville, it's for life.

179590995428478_438223489565226	"My brother lives in Nevada and decided to short sale his home because he had been out of work for almost a year. When he decided to do this he was still current on his payments.  He listed it with a real estate which had clients who were interested in the home and put a offer on it. The offer was over and above what he owed on his home.  He has done everything right to sell his home and after Bank Of America consistently gave him problems on his short sale, the people who were interested in buying his home decided not to.  What is wrong with this picture?  Bank of America was going to get their money for his loan. Bank of America constantly called him and after getting him on the phone asked for his phone number.  Bank of America sent this loan to collections and when collections call and the situation is decided with them on the phone collections tells him to call this person or that person which he has done several times over this period and these people either with Bank of America or their representatives have NEVER RETURN the phone call he made to them.  Bank Of America has been nothing less than unprofessional with their business practices.  If you want you money for the loan on this house why didn't you do you part to get this sale closed.  Apparently Bank of America would rather harass people instead of getting their money for a home that was going to be sold as a short sale.  This won't help my brother and the home he has lost but it might help someone who is in the same situation with your bank. It might help someone who might be thinking about buying a home and thinking about financing it through your bank.  "	0	1	0

199504650087085_440184179352463	"I  am just posting to express  my extreme disappointment in United Airlines. After having a flight delayed at Chicago ORD for over 10 hours, and therefore missing our international connections and reservations, we were assured time and again that we would arrive in LAX and receive a Hotel room to stay in until our flights home could be organised. Upon arrival at LAX at 3:30am we were RUDELY told at the gate that the hotels were not availiable and promptly sent away. As international customers we will never recommend flying United to anybody we know. We have been inconvenienced, lied to, ignored and then mistreated. United are excellent at placing the blame on other people eg: ""Chicago should have provided Hotel vouchers"". Having no faith in United Airlines after the extreme delay and many other issues, I expressively sought out confirmation that we would definately have a hotel to stay in at LAX. Instead United have basically told us that we do not matter and that it is perfectly ok to spend more than 24 hours sitting in an airport waiting for a plane that has experienced 'mechanical failure'. Or, alternatively perhaps we should just go venture out into a park and wait there from 3:30am until our flight at 10:30pm? How about that United? All I can say is that after 48 hours without access to a shower I sure hope United do not have us seated with anybody on the plane! Ha ha ha. Did I mention that we were told we would not have to worry about our checked luggage and that we could pick that up in Melbourne? Yet luggage can not fly international without the owner.

I read a post online that they had a up and coming 3DS game listed for $17, which is a steal, so that's why I decided to pre-order the game through them. I had to call their customer service department to get the order to process but I actually spoke to a representative who completed the order for me and gave me a confirmation number. Turns out that was a price listing error and they ended up cancelling the order, I was never informed until I decided to check on the order status weeks later.   Then I just said whatever I'll just pre-order it at the regular price through Target anyway, since it's free shipping it wouldn't matter that I was getting it online, this was my biggest mistake.   The game was released on 11/20 and here it is 11/27 and still no game! My order status still says ""Not shipped yet"" So I decided to call their customer service about it, and somehow a game that was pre-ordered (Meaning ordered in advance) is on back order. I still don't understand it, why would you take orders in advance for something and then have it on back order!   And of course this is the collector's edition that I specifically pre-ordered in order to get all the goodies that come with it. And if Target does not get me the game I ordered, I can now only get the regular edition, meaning I missed out on all of the cool stuff that comes with it. I am absolutely furious right now! If I had known all the hassle that I would have gone through I would have just ordered it at Game Stop, the only reason I went with Target to begin with was the low price and even that was a lie!   This is some of the worst service I ever received, and what's worse is the lady on the phone couldn't even guarantee me that I would be getting the game, she just kept saying they would send an e-mail about it in a few days.

The day of my flight you delayed it because you didnt have a pilot causing my family to miss the connecting flight. When i spoke to customer service they were no help until I got to the terminal in Amarillo and the ticket agent was able to rebook our flight. We waited 6 hours at dfw just to get to our destination because we were in fear of missing our sons graduation. On our way back this past Saturday we sat on the runway for 2 hours. The pilot said since our restroom was not working on the plane we needed to go to the restroom while they refuel. Needless to say we return from the bathroom and our flight was cancelled. There was no reason to cancel the flight due to weather when other planes were leaving DFW and Amarillo was clear! If you are going to cancel a flight you should make sure to rebook everyone on the flight within a 24 hour period. Better yet get us a working plane and send us out later. Also if a cancellation should have to take place and no flights available the next day you should offer hotel vouchers, food vouchers and not expect them to spend the night in the terminal until Monday. It was sickening watching the Amarillo flight on Saturday be cancelled when other flights were going into to Amarillo. Furthermore myself and other Amarillo bound passengers watched as a San Angelo flight was offered and given food vouchers, hotel and taxi vouchers and a 1000.00 flight voucher while we were told sorry no flights to Amarillo until Monday. They were also given a later flight! If you offer to one group of passengers because of weather related cancellations it should be given to all not pick and choose. I would love for you executive officers to experience what we went thru and you could possibly see the frustration and disgust. I am simply amazed at the attitude from ticket agents to reservations and I am thinking they need to realize we are the customer not their dog and our money pays their pay check. I sat on hold saturday evening with hold times in excess of 45 minutes. Furthermore on Sunday I was able to get a flight back to Amarillo however my husbands only alternative given by American was to fly to Lubbock. Once I arrived in Amarillo I had to drive to Lubbock after no sleep for 24 hours being in your terminal to pick up my husband. Can I charge you for the fuel costs to drive to Lubbock and the additional food expense for staying an extra day? How about I charge you for the business we lost not being at our own business because of your negligence? Are you that corporate that you forget one bad experience will cause you to lose 100 potential fliers? If you keep allowing passengers to be treated this way, you will go out of business just as other airlines have done in the past.

She could transfer to corporate but I was wasting my time because I TRULY could not get anyone to over turn a decision. I said hey, what number do I call if we get disconnected, she said, oh I can give you the number before I transfer you. I agreed, she read off the number and proceeded to hang up. I spoke with someone in customer service who told me the branch manager could make those decisions to help me and when I asked to speak to her supervisor she told me there was no point because I was only going to hear the same thing over again...WHAT A COINCIDENCE.I am not going to go into my conversation and bad experience with the 3rd person, she wouldnt even let me talk to the branch manager.

When I booked the tickets we were told that if one traveler was 12, and it did not matter if they were siblings, then the boys would not have to travel officially unaccompanied. Well when the agent for the camp the boys were attending arrived at the ticket counter the CSR said ""these two have to be ""badged"" and travel with an unaccompanied itinerary. There will be an additional 50.00 per child fee."" The agent for the camp was stunned and said he would pay the fee but that the parent, me, had told him they did not travel unaccompanied on the way there and did not have that service on the itinerary. The CSR then said, "" Well I think the parents are just trying to cut corners."" My son was listening and was worried that they might not get on the flight. The CSR then said she would get a supervisor to make the decision. The supervisor looked into the original booking and saw that we were never requested to book the younger than 12 boys as unaccompanied minors, and did not demand the extra fee. I have checked now both, by phone, and at a ticket counter in Denver and been told that the policy is, if anyone of the unrelated passengers is 12 then they do not need to be paid for as unaccompanied minors. I am mostly irritated that the CSR in Nashville changed the rules for the itinerary when the boys were on the return and then insulted me as a parent by saying I was trying to cut corners and making it seem as if money were more important than my son's safety. I will not be choosing Southwest again in the future, I have not been impressed with the service or the companies ability to meet the needs of our family. We will be sticking with United Airlines.

I call reservations who can't actually help me, but gets us a little closer. They then give me the customer service line to call after my trip has been initiated as reservations has ""no power to fix any problems I have"". By chance, as I check in, need to get on an earlier flight - as i go through the process, the website tells me the change is free, I go through all the steps, my fiance does too and hers goes through fine. As I click the last ""agree"", an error message comes up, tells me to go to the start and tries to charge me money, I then call reservations to find out what is the deal, while being on the phone with the first agent for over an hour on wait, I get placed back into the cue for an agent, amazing! then I finally get a new agent, request a supervisor, another 30 minutes. By the time i get the supervisor and she checks the information, the change fee is now tripled due to my wait time. So this lovely Saturday morning in NYC, I decide to call the customer service line. as i log on to my account to have the information handy, i see that my seats have again been changed to the 30's without my knowledge - and to top it all off - the ""Customer Service""  center is closed on weekends.

I have severe drug allergies which seriously limit which drugs I can take and the drug that was prescribed was not available.  While I was waiting I heard the pharmacist on the phone with the Doctor explaining that there was a national backorder on that drug for over 2 months and I would not be able to fill the script there or probably anywhere nearby.  The Doctor could not change the prescription because of my allergies so I would have to wait until Monday for another appointment.  The Pharmacist Brad was not happy with the response and suggested calling around to see if anyone had the drug.  It was late on Saturday and I was really not feeling well so I figured I would try the next day.    This morning, Sunday, I received a call from Brad at Rite Aid.  He told me that after I left he felt very bad for me because of my allergy restrictions and started calling around to see if he could locate the antibiotic for me.  He was able to find it in a neighboring town!  He stopped on his way home from work, on a Saturday night, and picked up the medication for me and wanted me to know that I could now come back to the pharmacy with my prescription and have it filled.   I am amazed and thankful for such caring and thoughtful customer service.   Too often we hear about being treated poorly, it is not very often that we hear a story of an employee that has gone so far above and beyond so I wanted to share this story with you.

In the case of a special sale, for example, you may find the price charged in one area of town is not the same as the price charged in another. Consequently, you may find our items at higher prices since retailers are at liberty to set their own prices.

7003656077_10150500853236078	"A Bad Experience with AA Gate Agents  I've had several chances to post about bad experiences with both Delta and United, and in the comments of those stories, someone asked if I'd post the same should I experience bad service on American Airlines.  Well, Friday the 27th was that day.  It started in San Jose, probably American's worst slew of gate agents as a group (even worse than Miami, which says a lot, but it's really only a few bad apples in Miami, which is a large hub  for AA - San Jose agents are arguably the worst about actually following proper procedures and responding with a customer service attitude).  I'll put up another post about my quibbles with handling the upgrade list, but the GA knowingly altered the boarding order, even telling another agent she was going to do it differently.  She then proceeded to board First Class (only), followed by Executive Platinum and Platinum.  You can only imagine the rush, as one of the benefits of Executive Platinum is priority boarding with the First Class passengers, so that if you're an EXP in coach you get first dibs on overhead space.  Several EXP's naturally tried boarding with First, only to be told ""no, we're doing it different, we're not boarding you yet.""  BAD experience.  The flight crew (both cockpit and cabin) for that flight, however, were excellent (as usual).  They even handled a catering screwup apologetically, and comped snack items for passengers who were inconvenienced.  In this case, the flight left at 3:50 PM PST and got into Dallas around 9:00 CST, so a ""dinner"" flight over three hours, which means catering should have loaded sandwiches for purchase (or, for EXP's, for free - which this flight crew knew about and got right).  That didn't happen (or not enough were loaded) so they were out of ""real"" food for sale, leaving only a couple tubes of chips and no snack trays.  Needless to say, passengers were not happy. but the FA's don't control what catering loads, and they really did try to accommodate people and/or comp what little was left in terms of drinks, etc.  Very professional.  Getting to Dallas, however, it was back to horrible gate agents.  In fact, in Dallas, I met someone who is arguably the worst gate agent AA has.  Meet Lottie, the GA working the Dallas - Austin flight.  I walked up for the flight (my originally booked flight, but changed due to my standby on the SJC-DFW flight) with the DOOR STILL OPEN.  Lottie, looking at me AT THE DESK (not just walking up), says nothing, but goes to close the door and close out the flight.  I mentioned that I was originally booked on the flight and asked about standby, and immediately she starts demeaning me, stating ""I've been making final call for minutes now, and you didn't board!""  ""Well, considering I just came off the SkyTrain escalator and walked up, it's probably because my connecting flight just arrived.""  ""Well I was calling and you weren't' here and I'm not putting you on the flight.""  ""But I'm here, and the door is open.  Why not walk me down with you?""  ""I'm not doing that.  The flight is closed,"" as she closes the door.  Absolutely poor customer service, and from my point of experience, a horrible attitude.  When I asked for her employee ID to file a complaint with CR, she refused, stating she didn't have to give me that.  Just like I've done with TSA personnel who refused to provide identification in Charlotte, I took her picture.  So, here it is.    If you see Lottie, my advice is to simply walk away.  Based on my interactions with her, you're not likely to have a pleasant interaction, and she's not likely to care about customer service in any form or fashion.  As AA ponders downsizing the workforce, this is one GA that would definitely get my vote for someone to be replaced with a self-service kiosk and automated boarding gates - it'd certainly be more pleasant and efficient.  Note: For those of you that think this is going too far, Lottie works in a public position and has no expectation of privacy with regards to her work situation.  I'm not posting any other information that someone walking through the airport couldn't see.  I'm simply posting my experience with her and using her as an example of an employee who, in my experience, does not live up to the expectation I have for customer service with American.  And did I email CR?  No.  It's honestly not worth the hassle.  I'll get a form-letter response that may or may not be on target with my complaint, and I'll have to respond a few more times until anyone notices.  Another aspect of American's customer service that needs significant improvement."	0	1	0

Is the expense, loyalty, and time I and so many others give daily to your corporation not enough? How is assuming more debt responsible in this economy? Why should I have to be treated poorly because I opted to maintain responsibility and stay out of debt by not signing up for a credit card so I too can to be treated with quality customer service? Mr. Anderson you have your priorities way out of line. Stop sitting behind a big desk once owned by a man who had a vision and started an airline founded on premier customer service and quality. Saying you want us to enjoy our travel and your focus is customer service is a lot of empty words we are sick of listening to. Actions speak louder than words. Start showing us you actually care and make a change."	0	1	0
117497138610_10150614067048611	"Dear Walgreen's,  It has come to my attention that you have discontinued the services of PetCaravan. I would like to express my absolute dismay, and, yes, outrage that a company as renowned as Walgreen's would listen and heed erroneous media propaganda! This is absurd!  PetCaravan has reputably served our Florida communities for many years, dependably and exceptionally. Their vets are licensed- I have asked and I have checked. They won't even give a shot without the vet there and doing it him/herself!! I couldn't afford to take care of my animals without them. Other shot clinics exist, but none have their record keeping that is comparable with a good vet's. The others are fly-by-nights with no customer service or support.  We need PetCaravan!!! The pets of our Florida communities need PetCaravan! I am so disappointed in Walgreen's right now. I thought Walgreen's was a community pharmacy, about and for our local communities. Taking away PetCaravan hurts our communities. Please reinstate PetCaravan immediately, as soon as possible, because every weekend without them, hundreds of dogs and cats throughout Florida are not getting their necessary vaccines. By reinstating PetCaravan, Walgreen's will be helping save lives, and helping our community.  I feel so strongly about this that I will discontinue my patronage to all Walgreen's stores and pharmacies in the future unless this atrocity is immediately rectified. I will also urge my friends, family, and colleagues to do the same. "	0	1	0

This is happening all around us and we are allowing this socialist government to keep growing. McMillian Mfg in Phoenix, Arizona, was contacted by Bank of America and informed that they will no longer be allowed to use their services ( Bank of America ) because they are in the firearms business and support the second amendment.  I am fine with you re-posting it. Thanks for your support.  Kelly D. McMillan Director of Operations McMillan Group International, LLC 1638 W Knudsen Dr Phoenix , Arizona 85027 McMillan Integrity-Global Vision   http://www.mcmillanusa.com/ http://www.facebook.com/McMillanGroupInternational  McMillan Fiberglass Stocks, McMillan Firearms Manufacturing, McMillan Group International have been collectively banking with Bank of America for 12 years. Today Mr. Ray Fox, Senior Vice President, Market Manager, Business Banking, Global Commercial Banking (Bank of America) came to my office. He scheduled the meeting as an ""account analysis"" meeting in order to evaluate the two lines of credit we have with them. He spent 5 minutes talking about how McMillan has changed in the last 5 years and have become more of a firearms manufacturer than a supplier of accessories. At this point I interrupted him and asked ""Can I possibly save you some time so that you don't waste your breath? What you are going to tell me is that because we are in the firearms manufacturing business you no longer want my business.""  ""That is correct"", he says. I replied ""That is okay, we will move our accounts as soon as possible. We can find a 2nd Amendment friendly bank that will be glad to have our business. You won't mind if I tell the NRA, SCI and everyone one I know that BofA is not firearms-industry friendly?"" ""You have to do what you must"", he said. ""So you are telling me this is a politically motivated decision, is that right?"" Mr. Fox confirmed that it was. At which point I told him that the meeting was over and there was nothing left for him to say.  I think it is important for all Americans who believe in and support our 2nd amendment ""right to keep and bear arms"" should know when a business does not support these rights. What you do with that knowledge is up to you. When I don't agree with a business' political position, I cannot, in good Conscience support them.

This is not the first food item from Walmart that I noticed is a product of CHINA. Walmart has always presented itself as a company that loves America and Americans and strives to help local economy BLAH BLAH BLAH Why then, would you ever find it sensible to import products from CHINA to sell in your stores. The same CHINA whose dog food filler killed many innocent pets here in America and devastated their owners. The same CHINA that had secretly been adding PLASTIC to milk and baby formula and selling it in its own country. If they care so little for the health of their citizens, WHY would any American ever want to eat food from there, let alone feed it to our children?  I stopped purchasing Great Value Grape juice several months ago, due to the contents being imported. Now I guess I need to check and recheck every product before purchasing from you. By the way, with the exception of some ethnic foods that you import, I can't think of but a few products in your store, that couldn't be purchased from American manufacturers. Shame on you!

12699262021_10150541029292022	"To Whom It May Concern:    I am writing to enlighten you on my recent and ongoing experience with your Best Buy Store in Bowling Green, Kentucky, and specifically in regard to your Geek Squad ""Black Tie Protection Plan"".  On Sunday January 8, 2012, I went into your store in Bowling Green, Kentucky, to have my MacBook Pro repaired due to a cracked screen. I was confident My Black Tie Protection Plan would quickly handle the situation. Your sales associate in the Geek Squad Department told me that the screen would be replaced and that my computer would be returned to me shortly. I was then passed on to another associate who checked me out. I was given a receipt with someone else's name on it. I asked that it be corrected, which it was, and I thought that was the conclusion of having my computer repaired.  On Monday January 9, 2012, I received a phone call from Best Buy stating that my MacBook had not been sent out yet because the phone number was wrong on the account. This was also corrected.  On Thursday January 12, 2012, I contacted Best Buy in Bowling Green for information on my MacBook. To my dismay, an associate, Bethany, told me the hard drive had been replaced, and that the screen had not been replaced because the crack was cosmetic and did not affect the ""working condition of the computer"". I then asked to speak with a store manager who assured me that they could recover my old files on DVD and have them mailed to me. I overheard another associate comment that they had probably already drilled out the old hard drive and recovery would not be possible. I am now waiting to see if I ever receive my data.  On Friday January 13, 2012, I once more contacted the Best Buy store. My computer had arrived. I traveled to your to the store to pick up my computer. Bethany was there and once more was very rude. I asked for the store manager to discuss the fact that the screen had not been repaired. He told me there was not anything they could do. So at this point I have a computer that still has a cracked screen and all my data is gone - I NEVER ASKED FOR, NOR WAS I INFORMED THAT MY HARD DRIVE WOULD BE REPLACED!   I took the computer home and began the OS updating process since everything had been erased and within a couple hours get the ""Blue Screen of Death"".  I forced a shutdown and the computer would no longer power up. At this point I have a computer that still has a cracked screen, my old hard drive was clearly replaced with a defective one, my computer is unusable, and I am getting answers from no one.  On January 14, 2012, I returned to your store to once again have my computer repaired. An associate/technician takes the computer and after two hours of waiting in the store he tells me he can't find a problem, but there clearly is one as the computer would not boot past the blue screen. I also noticed a large dent on the right side of the laptop body at this point. He told me the computer should be JUNKED. I said if I have the Black Tie Warranty why am I not just given a replacement MacBook Pro. He said an employee named Justin would be in within the hour and would check it out because he wasn't even certified to work on the MacBook. At this point I had been at the store for several hours so I left the computer with the associate and was told I would receive a call that evening with information. I never received a call.  On Sunday January 15, 2012, I called once more and was informed my computer had once again been sent off - I am given no further information.  I'm writing to whoever I can to make certain that this situation is remedied correctly. At this point your Black Tie Protection seems fraudulent, and the customer service department at your Best Buy in Bowling Green Kentucky appears incompetent. I was planning to make a few thousand dollars in purchases within this store over the coming year, but I no longer have the confidence to do so. I have lost thousands of dollars worth of work and data, spent a considerable amount of time and money traveling, and continue to lose money daily because I use the MacBook to operate a YouTube channel with thousands of subscribers.   At this time I will patiently wait until I get my MacBook Pro back and also wait to see if my data is returned to me on DVD as has been promised. If the situation is again handled poorly then I will have to pursue legal action as I see no other recourse. Please contact me with any information you are able to provide or with the contact information of anyone who may be able to see this is handled appropriately.   Sincerely,   Kevin Smith  "	0	1	0

He also won't allow anyone on Medicare, medicaid, or even if they are ELIGIBLE FOR Medicare but NOT ON Medicare, to use the Indiana Drug Card in the pharmacy.  I've researched and have found NO limitations or restrictions in using the Indiana Drug Card, and I have medicaid, but need a drug that is non-formulary.  I USED to be able to purchase it at a discount, but he removed the card from my profile and now will only sell me the drug for FULL PRICE.  This sounds way shady to me.

The only thing they would do for me was let me return it for their lowest clearance price which was 50% lower than what the original cost was. My mother called and spoke to a manager who seemed very understanding of the situation and told me to to return to the store for a full refund to get the matter resolved since most people buy baby gifts months in advance and typically the parents don't open and put everything together right away. When I got back to the store, she went back on her word and we were still stuck with a baby swing that doesn't work. Afterward, a phone call was made to the corporate office and tried to resolve the problem, but they still wouldn't do a thing about my swing that doesn't work.

Then, you connected me to an agent whose primary language was Spanish. Before you roll your eyes at the ""racist,"" you should know that my husband is not American born, and has not a drop of caucasian in his blood, so you can get over that. If she had spoken English well enough for me to remotely understand her, it would have been only a slight annoyance. However, she was so difficult to understand that I finally had to request an English speaking agent. I hate having to do that, because it embarrasses the poor agent who is doing the best that she can. So now you've made two people, your customer and your employee, highly uncomfortable.

Almost all of the nearly $25 million raised to oppose this proposition has come from a variety of the most soulless corporations...chemical, seed, and processed-food companies, including Coca-Cola, General Mills, Nestle, PepsiCo, and DuPont Pioneer. St. Louis-based Monsanto, a leading producer of genetically engineered seeds, donated $4.2 million, the largest donation!   Below are some interesting facts to know. Please boycott these brands immediately and send this email far and wide through your lists. I bet most of these foods are in our cupboards and refrigerators! And their GMO contamination is going to end up in our bodies.  * Kashi (owned by Kellogg, which has contributed $632,000 to defeat Proposition 37).  Kashi's so-called ""natural"" breakfast cereals have tested positive for the presence of GMOs.   Kellogg also owns the ""natural"" brands Bear Naked and Morningstar Farms.  * Silk Soymilk (owned by the nation's largest dairy, Dean Foods, which has contributed $253,000 to the effort to kill Proposition 37). Dean Foods also owns White Wave Tofu and Horizon milk and dairy products.  * R.W. Knudsen (owned by Smucker, which has contributed $388,000 to defeat proposition 37). Smucker also owns Santa Cruz Organic.  * Cascadian Farm (owned by General Mills, which has contributed $520,000 to defeat proposition 37). General Mills also owns Larabar and Muir Glen.  * Honest Tea (owned by Coca-Cola which has contributed $1,164,400 to defeat Proposition 37). Coca-Cola also owns Odwalla.  Tostito's Organic and Tropicana Organic. *  Naked Juice (owned by PepsiCo which has contributed $1,716,300 to defeat Proposition 37).   * ""O"" Organics (Safeway's private label line of organic foods). Safeway, like other ""No on 37"" companies, is a dues-paying member of the Grocery Manufacturers Association, which has contributed $375,000 to defeat Prop 37.  Help make sure their betrayal of consumers affects their bottom line. Please go to their Facebook pages and tell them what you think of their hypocrisy, or call their consumer response lines. Boycott these brands - the BETRAYERS of our right to know.

After my grandfather was diagnosed with pancreatic cancer in Sept., my wife and I made plans to fly home on Dec 21st to NC to see my grandfather for what looked to be his last Christmas. Last Thursday he took a turn for the worst and it did not appear that he would make it long enough for us to him. As a grandson who has always been close to his grandfather, everyone knew he was going to fight to stay alive until I could arrive. Our flight on the 21st was with US Airways and so I called to see if there was anyway they could help me switch my flight in order to get home ASAP to tell my grandfather goodbye. Instead of helping me and working with me to change my flight, the people I talked to were extremely rude and insensitive about the fact that it would cost an outrageous amount to change my ticket (Close to $500). In the end, I ended up having to eat the cost of my original plane ticket and found help from another airline in order get got me home approximately 5 hours before he passed away. My family and I were just blown away by the fact that no one from US Airways was willing to help. It was actually another airline that understood my plight and went out of their way to help get me home in time to say goodbye to my amazing grandfather. I thank you for listening to my experience during this tough time and hopefully by me bringing it to your attention, some other military member will not have to endure the same type situation.

I went to talk to the manager, but she didn't let me begin to speak and immediately raised her hand pointed to a cashier with a rude body language. The cashier stopped attending us halfway through the transaction and attended a personal phone call with little to no customer service skill. Her cashier number is #10. However, the two male employees at the store were very courteous and very helpful. I have always had a pleasant experience dealing with AutoZone before, and this sloppy service is very harmful to the company because it causes it to lose potential clients. I hope you resolve this issue to correct the blemish on AutoZone's good name. We are keeping the receipt, and wish to be contacted for a follow up on this complaint.  Maybe this problem occurred because of racial prejudice since we spoke Spanish in the store, while the people who spoke English in the store were treated very courteous. However, we are graduated professionals, and we speak both languages properly. This has been an embarrassment on the company in Miami where the majority speaks Spanish. We hope this complaint is resolved quickly so other customers don't experience the same disrespect that we have and AutoZone remains the professional company that it is.  "	0	1	0

I can assure you that the defeat of Prop. 37 in CA is not the end of GMO labeling, it is just the beginning of a strong movement to label GMOs in all of North America. Your $800,000 contribution to the deceptive advertising campaign that led to the defeat of Prop. 37 is a direct insult to the health, safety and intelligence of the consumers who buy your products.   I am committed to telling at least 100 people in my network that your products contain genetically modified ingredients which       * have not been adequately tested to prove their safety      * are heavily sprayed with the herbicide, RoundUp, and     * are patented by chemical companies that engineered them in a lab and turned them into EPA registered pesticides   I will tell them that your company has no regard the the health and safety of consumers who buy your products and that your company is driven strictly by greed.   You can't hide the truth. Americans want the same GMO free foods you sell in countries that require that GMOs are labeled. I hope to hear soon that you have reassessed your corporate values and will eliminate GMOs from your products so that I can enjoy them again. "	0	1	0

In exactly 1 month my family has lost and buried an uncle, my dad was life flighted to Kootenai Medical Center from Bonners Ferry, ID and put on life support and in a coma for roughly 36-48hrs due to a severe reaction to a mixture of medicine (he's a disabled back patient who's had numerous surgeries. On his most recent MRI his Dr. Said ""I've never seen a worse back"") This past week our nephew, niece, and sis-in-law were in a severe multi vehicle accident that closed highway 95 for several hrs and has been covered in multiple papers in the northern Idaho, Spokane area. My nephew was life flighted to sacred heart in Spokane where he had facial reconstruction surgery, surgery on his left arm and right leg. His jaw was broke on both sides and his right eye socket was close to shattered. His liver lacerated and lung bruised. My sister stayed with him and has learned to help with his care and therapy so she can help care for him at home. The whole community in Bonners Ferry has reached out to him and our family. Helping hands has collected donations, the local Super 1 store is doing a snowboard raffle, proceeds going to my nephews medical expenses. All this in 1 month and so much support, yet my sister sits right now in bonners ferry, idaho safeway store #2954 where she's employed trying to keep her job because she's missed work in the past month. I understand work goes on and needs to be done but this still seems wrong to me."	0	1	0
7003656077_10151155643626078	"I'm pretty appalled with the competency level of your employees. Having flown with a number of airlines, my experience with yours was hands down the worst. Going to check in for an international flight and trying to check in using one of your machines, we went through the whole process wasting time only to be told at the very end to speak to an agent as we need 'assistance'. After speaking to an agent A, at this point coming to close to an hour before our international flight, he told us to go see some other agent B instead of helping us get through a line up and getting us checked in. Agent B then said we had to actually go through the check in line up where agent A was standing providing 'assistance'. So after waiting in line behind 2 people, watching FIVE OF YOUR AGENTS take at least 10 minutes to check in one person each, we of course missed the check in cutoff. The young man behind the counter was nice enough to put us on stand by for next morning's flight (or so we thought) albeit with no apology on your airline's part for making us go from one line up to another effectively making us miss our flight. So the next morning at the airport, we find out that we actually have our boarding passes from yesterday that we can use for our new flight (it would have been nice to know we didn't actually need to check in at 6:30am). Again after being told to go from one security checkpoint to another, making us wait in the longest line-ups imaginable (even after your agents took a look at our boarding passes noting it is an international flight), one of them had the great idea to let us go through to the front of the line. After going through security, we made it to our gate only to find out we weren't actually on the standby list!!! I can only attribute to good luck the fact there were enough empty seats on the flight so we actually made it home that day. So all in all, that is 1 somewhat forward-thinking employee of yours we dealt with out of 7. I don't think I will voluntarily be booking a flight with AA again. You should probably re-think your training procedures as all this is doing nothing for your image. "	0	1	0

Then said bagger talks about snapping the neck of the other person and not to get it on video because that could be used as evidence against him.

12699262021_10151247581997022	"I just thought I'd comment on a recent web order from Virginia with an in-store pickup by a colleague in California. I have done this a couple of dozen times so that my wife can pick up items for me when she happens to be in town -- Well, I went to all the trouble to add the colleague's name to my account profile - this seemed like it was going to be really easy.. While I was going through the checkout process, picking the closest store in California, editing the billing information, etc. I began to worry about being able to add that ""to be picked up by"" person from my profile. So I hit the chat button on the page to ask where that entry could be made. After a couple of minutes it became obvious that it was not obvious when that annotation might be made on the in-store delivery options.(Big Mistake #1). The assistant on chat said that there was no way to specify an alternate pick-up for an in-store pickup and suggestion that I contacted toll-free customer care.  I placed the alternate pickup information into the guest recipient fields on the web.  I called customer care, gave the type of item to the initial call screener so they could direct me to the proper resolution group. I explained the situation to customer care and HAD TO REPEAT ALL OF THE INFORMATION that was on the order confirmation, including my address, email address phone number, credit card and end-recipient's name email address and phone number  - evidently the customer care folks don't have ACCESS to all of the order information when they are trying to resolve the problem -- Big Mistake #2.  After repeating all the information, the helpdesk said they would have to cancel the order and re-enter it with the alternate recipient's information and that the cancellation wouldn't show up on my  credit card for a couple of days..   So far I was into this for about 25 minutes. Since I have developed complex eCommerce and Command and Control Systems I asked that an error report be written against this implementation flaw and that I be forwarded a copy. If this error has manifested itself on a Thursday, I would have cancelled the transaction and ordered from Amazon with free delivery -- I was put on hold and after 10 minutes of dead air I hung up and called again.  The process was repeated..  This time with a transfer to a supervisor so that I could make sure that the error report was submitted. Dead air on the transfer.(Mistake #3)  Once again, I called - this time the held desk called the store and explained the situation and got the order amended..  Again I asked to be transferred to a supervisor so that an error report against the web site could be submitted and I got cut off again.(Mistake #4)  I called back again just to submit an error report against the web and got cut off again..(Mistake #5)  I think I now understand why Amazon is eating your lunch, You eCommerce site is abysmal and 3/4  your customer service representatives are uncaring or inept.  The next time you roll-out a website, I'll be willing to perform testing of you new implementation at my regular biillable rate. "	0	1	0

179590995428478_328900833830826	"Hi there, last month I paid off my open loan balance.  Before I paid the balance I checked online for the pay off amount and I called the phone service (800-448-7067) to confirm my balance. Both gave me the same amount and as such that is the amount I paid; only to get a bill three weeks later for interest and charges.  I called Customer Service in an attempt to get the charges reversed and they said no, even after I escalated to a supervisor.  They gave me a new pay off amount good for today, which was different than my statement, however when I call the phone service to pay via phone I get a different amount (the amount on my statement). So I am reverting to this forum to say I am very disappointed and feel like BofA is playing games with customers.  I thought I fulfilled my obligation last month; I went to two resources to ensure I had the correct payoff amount, only to find out the information was wrong.  If BofA is going to give customers access to their accounts online and via the phone then the data should be as of that day/time, AND it should be the same no matter what avenue you go to. I've worked with other financial institutions who always give ""todays"" payoff amount; I am not sure why BofA can't. And at this point I am not confident that even if I pay the amount I was given today that I won't get another bill.  I am sure customer service is important to BofA and feel that due to the issues I am outlining above the additional fees/interest should be waived and BofA should implement new procedures with their online system to avoid this frustration with other customers.

To whom ever is reading this please understand that I have had 4 hours to cool down, and I am still furious.  Here is my situation, I purchase a laptop computer for my daughter as a Christmas present on Dec. 17, 2010, I paid for it on Dec. 17, 2010, and picked it up on Dec. 23, 2010, as the Geek Guys took that long to install and do whatever it is that they do with a new computer to make it 'better', I also purchased the 2 year extended warranty. In December 2011 the computer was over-heating, so I brought it in for repair, it took 2 weeks to have it fixed because, apparently at this point it was still under the manufactures warranty.  So today, 2 years to the day that I picked up the computer, I again returned it to Best Buy, with the same over heating issues and other problems. Only to be told by the clerk that it is out of warranty because I purchased and paid for the computer on December 17, 2010 and the warranty has expired.  I asked to speak with the store manager; a young man introduces himself as the manager, and tells me that there is nothing he can do because it is out of warranty.  (Please also keep in mind that I made sure that it was know that it was a Christmas gift and that it would not be used until Dec. 25, 2010 when I bought it).  The 'Manager' offered to send it out for an estimate on the repairs, and that the most he could do would be to split the cost with me or if it the cost was to much I could purchase a new computer.  So here is my dilemma, I feel used and abused.the 2 year warranty is really only a 1 year warranty because the manufacture covers the first year and the second year starts, not from the date of use but from the minute Best Buy has my money. I know that the extended warranty should cover more than the manufactures warranty and they tell you that the repairs will be done on location, however if it is something the manufactures warranty covers then it is getting sent to them.   When I was leaving the Geek Squad counter I requested the managers card, I was told I would have to ask the Bag Checker at the front door, I was told to ""ask him for the ""sales Manger's card"" .so to add insult to injury the ""manager"" that I request is not the 'manager' that introduced himself as the 'Manager'.  The part that gets me is that it was a Christmas gift and I fully expected the warranty to be in place from Christmas not before, as it was wrapped and not in use; unless you consider the time it sat in the store before it was ready for pick up. Even the Grinch got a heart at Christmas! I guess Best Buy hasn't watched that movie yet! "	0	1	0

You are responsible for shortening my lifespan by a minimum of six months through your toxic blend of hubris, incompetence, and blatant lying.  Today, in one of your typical acts of random cruelty, you called me, put me on hold for a very long time, then disconnected me.  The noteworthy aspect of it is that it's completely not noteworthy- it is actually the standard way you interact with the customer- blame the victim, then further victimize, then disengage, then repeat.  Meanwhile, be sure to add fees and penalties at every step of the way.  Ensure that the customer can never reach you- all contact must be intiated by bank of america, at the time least convenient for the customer.  Then, when the customer has missed/cancelled whatever plans they had, disconnect.  Disavow all knowledge.  Apologize by blaming the victim.  Suggest that the victim may have imagined the call.  And of course, market your exceptional customer care at every touchpoint- most importantly, when the customer is on hold just prior to disconnection."	0	1	0

129945096760_356213677804109	"http://sumofus.org/campaigns/shell-kiobel/ Today, one of the most significant U.S. Supreme Court cases of our time begins. At stake is whether or not corporations can literally get away with murder.  When the Ogoni people of Nigeria began to nonviolently protest Shell's oil development, Shell colluded with the Nigerian military regime to violently suppress opposition through extrajudicial killing, torture, and crimes against humanity. More than 60 villages were raided, over 800 people were killed, and 30,000 more were displaced from their homes.  This precedent-setting Supreme Court case could finally bring justice for the Ogoni people of Nigeria, but corporations like Dole Foods filed briefs to the Supreme Court in support of Shell to protect their own interests and make sure they can't be held accountable for human rights abuses abroad either.  Will you join us in telling Dole Foods to immediately pull its name from its amicus brief in the Kiobel v Shell case before the court makes its ruling?"	0	1	0

7003656077_10150661017436078	"Open Letter to American Airlines.  I was flying to LA yesterday morning to my aunt's funeral. I checked in the night before, I paid extra to get a decent seat a seat not in the middle of the row, and downloaded my electronic boarding pass on the AA smart phone app. I got to the airport on time, but when i tried to use the AA smart phone app to produce my boarding pass, It it kept freezing my phone, finally after trying with an AA employee for about 5 minutes to get it working, she suggested that I use their ticket kiosk for my boarding pass. But guess what, by then the time to use the electronic kiosk had expired and I was told that now I had to stand in line to see an agent; the line was about 200 people long so I would miss my flight.  This useless ""line greeter"" knew very well that It was a technical problem with their app so all she had to do was use her head have some compassion, offer a modicum of customer service and walk me over to a window, explain the situation to the agent, and get me out of there. It would have taking what, 3 mins? I just needed the boarding pass.   But NOOO, that would be WAY too thoughtful practical and not the AA way. No, their solution was to compound grief with stress by offering to let me stand in line for 30 minutes, miss my flight and take the next one 3.5 hours later, and, miss the funeral. I explained that I was only going to LA for this FUNERAL which was at 9:30. if I missed it there wold be no point in going at 10:00 which why I was flying at 6:15 in the morning, but no amount of explaining or pleading worked.   Dejectedly I gave up and was waiting for my ride back home When I saw Virgin America's ticket counter, so I ran over to them explained situation, in spite of the fact that it was now 6:35 they did everything they could to get me on their 7:00AM flight, I just missed it, but not due to lack of effort or caring by Virgin, the security process held me up, but Virgin America did get me on their 8:00 AM fly and I was in LA by 9:15. I missed the mass but did make it just in time for the funeral. Thank you, Thank you Virgin America Airlines.   I've flown with American Airlines for 25 years but after this I will NEVER EVER book another AA flight, I will gladly pay more to fly on any other airline.   I hope this post is seen by the management at AA so as you continue losing passengers to Virgin, JetBlue and Southwest you'll understand why.  AA get this through your dense corporate heads. We fly because we have to, passengers are people and our lives do not fit into the neat columns set forth by your corp. bean counters. Sometimes thing goes wrong and that's when a little customer service goes a long way.   When dealing with the death of a family member the last thing one needs is to compound grief with corporate disinterest and inflexibility. My needs would not have disrupted AA operations one bit, but It would have made a terrible situation just a little more tolerable  If you spent a fraction of your energy in trying to make the flying experience even minimally satisfying rather than just figuring out ways to nickel and dime us charging fees for luggage, a decent seat ( in coach) or for a soggy sandwich and bag of nuts etc. you would have customer loyalty like Southwest, Jet Blue and Virgin Airlines and you wouldn't constantly be on the verge of bankruptcy expecting the US tax payer to bail you out.  Maybe someone in authority should try flying AA as a incognito passenger, and not in a private Corp jet, and have even a minor problem to see what the flying public has to deal with.  On another Note Enterprise car Rental also showed remarkable customer service, I called them from LAX letting them know of my predicament and time crunch, so they were waiting for me and and had me out the door in less than 5 minutes.   Dear American Airlines, send your agents and line greeters to Virgin Airlines or Enterprise Car Rental so they can learn something about customer service, the flying public who continue to use your airline will be most grateful.   Sincerely   Alfredo Zaparolli"	0	1	0

6806028948_10151118159743949	"Dear SWA,  I am appalled at the treatment my Marine got earlier today at LAX's counter.  He was going to attempt to come home EARLIER than waiting 3-hours for a flight to RNO and I had gotten an over-the-phoen quote of $30 and was assured from ""Pat"" he wouldn't have a problem taking this flight for that small fee (one that I disagree with for Service Members of ANY BRANCH).  When he checked-in, he was treated very rudely at the counter and they insisted on him paying an additional $75 for this change in itinerary.  He is only home for a short time - two weeks, before going to his overseas duty station, and only wanted to spend MORE time with his family and friends rather than wait at the airport.  Had I found out about it sooner when he was at the counter, I would have been on the phone for him instantly, but I didn't have that luxury.  I TRUSTED that everyone would be on the same page, and he would have been offered the respect that he deserves and be allowed to come home to his family at the price stated and not what the ""normal"" passenger would have to pay.  This is unacceptable and I would hope that some sort of ""thank you"" or apology be given to him on a future flight that I'm sure he will take in two years when he comes back home!

I have been doing business with them for years today I had a problem with my computer so I took it in because I have the warranty and they told me they are sure its not repairable ans my warranty would cover a new computer ..now when they sold me the warranty they said if it couldn't be repaired I would walk out with a new one but today they said someone will call so I can go pick out a new one within couple weeks so now no computer and I have to drive like 40 miles back someday for new one and at 4$ a gallon that's expensive trip and when I talk to regional manager he said I should have bought my computer somewhere closer..what the shit is that let alone when they push that very expensive warranty on you and reassured me if couldn't repair I would walk out with new one..well its not fixable and I walked out with nothing. I can't believe they told me I should have bought computer closer to home. WOW that's just wrong	0	1	0

It appears that B of A doesn't support our 2nd Amendment right to bear arms hence the corporate decision to dissolve the relationship because McMillan is a ""gun"" manufacturer.     That is certainly the right of B of A, but it also our right to close our accounts with this financial institution in support of companies like McMillan.

I don't care how busy you are, the courtesy of saying ""please hold"" or some other greeting would be appropriate. Picking up the receiver and putting me on hold or hanging up over and over for 20 minutes without acknowledging the caller is beyond rude - no matter what the circumstances.

They only refunded my account $10 stating that yes, the acknowledged that I'd made several hundered dollars in transfers to my saving(s) accounts (one such transfer to savings was for $1K my severance package), none of the actual transactions were for $75 (the $150 weekly to the house checking account didn't count either). So I called my branch today to ""find out whats up with that"" and they told me that since I've been given partial credit for these transactions, their hands were tied to give me my funds back..... What's wrong with this picture .... I'm seriously going to consider closing my bank account with Wells Fargo.  I know $10 isn't a bunch of money, but to me it's the prinipal.  I feel cheated, since I more then complied with their stipulations."	0	1	0

To fall back on an additionally lame excuse of wanting to see a proper interpretation of US law also begs the question. The question of Dole is: Why have you joined this PARTICULAR case, when there are literally thousands of other cases that Dole could join, seeking a proper interpretation of US law? Again, there has to be more to this than the excuses, not reasons, that Dole's PR team has put up. Why doesn't Dole actually answer some questions. Like how it conducts its own overseas operations in 3rd World countries, when it thinks that it is out of sight of anyone. Or perhaps get its bank of attorneys to answer the questions of what is so special about this case.  As a Dole consumer who has suspended his purchases of Dole products until Dole withdraws its brief or until he must permanently not do business with Dole in the future, I would urge Dole to reconsider its position."	0	1	0

Apparently I did not receive a bill in the mail one month and even though I should have ""known to check"" according to your help line personnel, I missed paying it. The next month I did receive the bill and noticed I had a $27 late fee and penalty charge on a $63 bill. I called and was told the aforementioned statement along with the fact that it was authorized and legal. Well, regardless of whether it is or not, it doesn't seem like good business sense to have a steady and consistent customer cancel because he ends up frustrated due to inability of your cc personnel to make reasonable adjudication in such circumstances.

I just hand washed the dress I also both that day and when I turned it inside out to let it dry found a huge rip under the dress's sleeve (the dress was wore once and hand washed). It is very disappointing that 2 articles I bought the same day turned out to be such bad quality, I understand that you don't make them but these are brands you carry. I do not have the receipt for the dress anymore since I never thought on returning it but would like to get an answer as to what I can do to get my money refunded. I have pictures of the rip on the dress, I can fit my hand in it.

The Client List is a series on Lifetime Television which focuses on a fictitious day spa with massage therapists involved in unprofessional, illegal and inappropriate sexual contact with clients. Therefore your company is promoting sex from a massage therapist and human trafficking. Victims of human trafficking are forced to work at establishments offering commercial sex under the name of legitimate massage. Licensed massage therapists (LMT's), like chiropractors and other medical professionals, adhere to a strict code of professional conduct. A tremendous level of training is required to achieve the status of LMT as well as ongoing yearly continuing education requirements. The ""Client List"" directly attacks this profession, creating a negative and unfair bias against LMT's by the same public that they strive to serve.

Not only are the UPs not getting sent to my card correctly, but they dont print what ups were sent to the card correctly on the receipt, so you have no way of knowing what you got and neither does customer service and taking away OUR decision on how to use OUR rewards is NOT cool.  Seriously, it's more hassel than its worth to shop at Rite Aid now. I understand the overall goal is to help with people clearing shelves, discourage so much Extreme Couponing and to probably help sales by making customers come back the next day to use their UP's, but in the end I think you will find most of your loyal customers (mostly couponers I'm sure) will get tired of dealing with this hassel and go to the many other options out there. While I impatiently and slightly peeved, wait the next two weeks for my UP's to arrive I will be taking my business elsewhere. I know I am only one person, but I can see from others comments that I am not the only one taking my business elsewhere.  So I ask, is this new program really worth all the negative publicity?

However, business class was overbooked and I was downgraded, because it was a reward flight. Apparently paying with miles doesn't count. While I do understand the policy of overbooking, I don't see why a reward flight after having flown extensively (in business) means less. So much for rewarding Star Alliance loyalty... Your ground staff at TXL and the crew inflight, however, were really professional and tried to make up. While I do appreciate their efforts and would like to ask you to pass on the message, I'd still like to stress that people book business for the kind of comfort that cannnot be recreated by a row of 3 economy plus seats. The aircraft was late coming in and had a technical issue, so we were late going out. I missed my connection in EWR, partly because apparently the ground staff there had no idea about connecting passengers or how to speed up the immigration and customs process to allow connecting passengers to catch their next flight. That I found quite annoying. I've been in similar situations before, but ground staff in, just to give examples, BKK or NRT were prepared and efficient. Since I missed my connecting flight, I again was downgraded into economy. The fact that my bags were lost, as well, probably can't be blamed on you as connections were on a different carrier. It was, overall, quite a disappointing experience and for some reason I'm glad my return leg will be on other carriers that have shown consistent care for their customers."	0	1	0

147285781446_10151137828956447	"Whatever happened to American common sense? The reaction of Dick's to remove certain weapons is similar to those politicians who wish to ban those weapons as though the weapons are the problem, that there is a quilt associated with the weapons. Since most violent murders in this country are not even committed with such weapons, it would appear that Dick's policy decision to remove such weapons would be like Hardware Stores removing hammers or axes, or Auto Supply Stores removing crow bars. Many more people are murdered by those type of items each year than by AR-15 semi-automatic weapons, yet there is no uproar over hammers, axes or crowbars.   There is a distinct lunacy catching on in this country, ignoring the real issues while creating false issues that will never address the problems, this is not the only instance where such lunacy is being employed, but it certainly is one of the better examples.   You would think that if gun control, banning guns or taking certain guns off the market were the answer then the City of Chicago would be a model city without any violent gun crime, with some of the toughest gun control laws on the books, but it's not. All the City of Chicago did was deny good people a way to adequately defend themselves against the bad guys.  Additionally, it might come as a surprise to some of those people who call for gun control to know that in every case of mass killings involving guns in the last 15 or 20 years, the killer or killers were on some type of anti-depressants. The most likely cause of such breaks with reality is a mixture of mental illness and the side-affects of these drugs that are all too freely prescribed to patients.   Dick's decision is the wrong decision, but let them play-up and use the situation in some twisted PR stunt. I frankly find the action repulsive!

I figured with them being so expensive it would be a good thing for me to get.

My question is that if I pay $170 bucks for a maintenance plan and my phone fails then why the heck would I get a plain old piece of crap phone to replace it until a new one gets shipped in?  Seems kind of like purchasing a Corvette and getting a Pinto as a loaner vehicle.  As if all that weren't enough, they told me that all the pictures/contacts were on a card that they transferred to the loaner phone so I believed them but when I got home (after they had closed of course) I looked on the card and there were no pictures to be found besides the 10 or so default pictures that come with every phone, guess I can kiss those pictures goodbye.

The store I visited, which is only one close by constantly has issues with taking coupons and there is certainly some issue with your registers when you see the coupon on the screen but its no where to be found on the reciept.  The cashier I had tonight was marking several of my coupons down and didn't even scan some but still took them and put them in the drawer and when i had the manager come over she couldn't explain to me on the reciept where my coupons came off.

Walton beach Florida to Louisville, Kentucky and paid $207 for the ticket and ended up having to cancel today.....well little do they let you know when ordering the ticket that if you have to cancel because of an emergency that you will get a credit for what you paid for the ticket and also get charged a FEE when you go to use this so called CREDIT that they give you instead of a refund. So correct me if I'm wrong but when you are given a credit, it should be a credit for whatever you paid for the ticket and not be charged a fee to use it. I however was told that I would get the credit and have a year to use it but when I went to use it I would have to pay a FEE to use MY CREDIT which comes to $190 (the fee) on top of the price of the ticket that I bought which is $207 so I would be paying a total of $397 for a one way ticket....yes I am irate !!!!

And maybe when you do receive a request to cancel a card from someone other than the owner, maybe you could call or email the actual owner? Have you considered that this poorly designed process could allow anyone with a list of credit card numbers to call and cancel them all, causing a major service disruption? I understand we want to try to keep the cc# private, but get real, it isnt. thousands of vendors have access to my credit card number. And maybe when the person calls to get the card replaced, you should actually be able to do that without telling them ""if I place the order for a new card, you wont be able to get a temporary"" Maybe you shouldnt have an online chat when a customer who takes the time to use it just has to call in anyway after taking the time to type it all out. And then have to explain to the agent only to have to explain again to the supervisor who tells you the only thing that you have to go into the bank branch and explain again.

This organization is a radical group that is not at all connected to the local animal shelter as it's name would indicate. In fact, if you investigate you will find that less than one half of one percent of it's budget is used for the care and saving unwanted pets. Instead they are a radical animal rights group with one goal, to abolish animal agriculture. Yes, they are vegans and vegetarians who believe all of animal agriculture is bad. I'm assuming, across America, you have livestock producers and agriculturalists who do millions of dollars worth of business with you. This is a direct slap in the face to your customers and I hope you will reconsider your business relationship with HSUS. Until I hear otherwise, I will not being doing business with Bank of America and I will prompt other agriculturalists voice their dismay with your bank and reconsider their banking choices with you as well.  Thank you. Melissa Hart"	0	1	0

For several months, the company's Facebook page has become something of a marketing embarrassment. It's plastered with comments by angry consumers calling the company out for fighting GMO labeling, and threatening a boycott until the company changes its ways.  Other consumers are choosing to buy products from companies that are going GMO-free. In fact, consumer demand for non-GMO products is rising fast.

If children and families are you're market then race and country of origin should not change you're approach to appealing to you're market. Fact being you're attempt for lowering you're ideology to a fascist corporate strategy will only hurt you're business here as well. This lust for profit will in time destroy you're American customers view of your product there by lowering profit in the long term. Please see all people as persons who deserve the same respect as you're customers because we all know the real way to vote you out for a real family company is to just stop buying you're products. I will stop purchasing Dole products until you stop these atrocious acts. I will buy fruit not covered in children's blood.

I now cannot go to work tomorrow and am going to miss out on a full day of pay because your flight (PHL to LAX flight 39 at 8:30 pm on 9/18) took off before several passengers even had a chance to board, after US Airways employees at the information kiosk told us all we would have plenty of time to make it to the gate because flight 39 was also delayed. There should had been at least full motel accomodations paid for those of us passengers who were lied to and running just to ensure we made our flight!!!!!!! I want to know what you intend to do to compensate for my missed time at work and for the motel room I had to pay for because of being lied to about making the connection flight to LAX!!!!!!!!! There should be compensation not only for myself, but for the other passengers that were also lied to!!!!!!!

The company has taken a stand against Prop 37, however, to avoid having to label its products as containing GMOs in California. Many analysts believe that a win for the proposition in California could open the flood gates for more states to adopt such laws, which is exactly what companies like Kellogg's and similar companies want to avoid.

When asked why the change and what could they do to help me, Customer service informed me there was nothing that they could do for me, so I informed them that like most of unemployed America who bank with Wells Fargo, we are now looking for new banks because of this stupidity.

Honestly I've never, ever heard the excuses such as the ones you have provided.  I guess it is not enough that Democractic Party and others are going to stop banking with you due to the way you have been treating people who have had the misfortune to fall behind on their mortgages due to the economy.  Totally unjust, I believe you need to understand that there are people that are struggling behind your decisions and most of these people are elderly or have families.  Darci Sosa and her family have been trying in every way possible and in ""Good Faith"" to get to a justified decision and all you have been doing is ignore their phone calls, faxes and other means of communication while lying to them.  I think the President Obama really needs to take a look how your bank does business and how people who are facing foreclosure are being unjustly treated.  President Obama, I'm going to find a way to share this communication with you and implore that you take action in reviewing how Bank of America is doing business and not working in ""Good Faith"" with people who are facing foreclosure.

YWCA CEO Dara Richardson-Heron, M.D. wrote, ""As a nonpartisan organization dedicated to eliminating racism, empowering women and promoting peace, justice, freedom and dignity for all, we have decided to withdraw our sponsorship effective immediately.""  Mark A. Stephenson, Head of Corporate Communications of Philips North America, wrote, ""While the Commission on Presidential Debates is a non-partisan organization, their work may appear to support bi-partisan politics. We respect all points of view and, as a result, want to ensure that Philips doesn't provide even the slightest appearance of supporting partisan politics.""  Cronyism is hardly new to the two party duopoly. In fact, this duopoly has repeatedly bailed out Southwest's competitors, who were unable to match Southwest's more efficient business practices.  Americans deserve a true presidential debate, not an artificially restricted one. We ask Southwest Airlines to join Philips, BBH, and the YWCA, and withdraw its sponsorship of the Presidential Debates."	0	1	0

12699262021_10150955337372022	"When I logged on yesterday to one of the home computers that I bought at Best Buy, an application opened announcing that my subscription to Kaspersky Anti-Virus 2012 had expired, and that I should renew it right away.  So I paid about $44 online, but the application crashed, and I received no email acknowledgment of the transaction.  However, the Kaspersky Anti-Virus application on my computer suddenly showed the renewal, and file updates/  I called Kaspersky, who told me that the application was triggered by Best Buy, who handled renewals on their software for equipment that Best Buy had installed on.  After a series of hideous finger-pointings, misdirections, poor listening, pointless diagnostics in several calls (because they dropped the line twice during extended periods on hold to ""research the situation further"") into Best Buy customer service, reward zone, and Geek Squad, I was able to find out that there was another year or more on my Kaspersky subscriptions, and that no such application should have popped up to blow away the majority of my working day.  It could have been some clever virus trying to rip me off.  No such luck.  When I called my bank, they informed me that no authorizations had taken place against my credit card.  Falls about as far short of excellence in customer contact as I can imagine.  How could I possibly recommend Geek Squad to anyone except perhaps a bitter enemy?  Best Buy and the Geek Squad needs to have better testing on the behavior of the software that they install on customer equipment, and their CSRs must be much better trained at listening carefully, rather than rushing into ""cookie cutter"" solutions that in no way fit the situation at hand.  The level of disconnect that took place here far exceeds anything in my experience.  They should have the good sense to go back and listen to the recording that they made of my conversations with their staff, and figure out how to turn the situation around."	0	1	0

78143372410_10151151638037411	"I wish I had taken down the name of one of your employees at the Scottsdale and Shea store locations in Arizona, what she did was incredible in bad taste. So your store states it is open till 3pm Arizona time, and I know I called in the morning to find out if that was still the case, I was told it was. So I arrived at 2:45 PM went to the auto door on the south entrance and it was locked shut and had carts in front of it. So I proceeded to the other doors where they were letting people out but guarding so that no one could get in, there was an employee outside, not the manager stating that the manager would not let anyone in, bear in mind I am not the only one trying to get in there was about 20 of us. I completely understand the employees wanting to be with their families, as a member of the United States Army there have been many times I wanted to be with my family but could not for many different reasons or circumstances!! But see the thing is, it basically comes down to principles, if you advertise and state that you will be open till a certain time, people are going to take your word for it, I was lucky all I needed was rynolds wrap and ranch dressing, but I can promise others needed more and it may have messed up their plans. But while that is a complaint of mine, the issue that bothered me most was that the same employee who was not letting others in asked one of the people standing around what they needed maybe she was making the biggest fuss, I honestly do not know, but the lady stated all she needed was a type of cheese, your employee pulled her inside and was able to get her the cheese she needed, which was great for her, but going back to principles, if you do something for one you do it for all! The fact she made a scene about it around others she would not help was in bad taste and poor judgment. I am not saying how to run your company, but I believe you need to re educate yourself employees on customer relations and service, because your Scottsdale store failed miserably! I hope this post doesn't fall on deaf ears and you are able to fix the issues. Thank you for your time!"	0	1	0

Whether you're aiming or not, you are promoting a democratically suppressing organization.  Since censoring democracy would be a political agenda, you are inadvertently doing the opposite of what you are suggesting.  If you do not believe the Commission on Presidential Debates is a democratically suppressing organization, then you are ignoring the difficulty it would take for a candidate to surpass a 15% support in the polls without the credibility of inclusion in public debates.  The only limitation the CPD should take is that a candidate must be on enough ballots that total 270 electoral votes.  Anything else is suppression.  Imagine if the government said that travel booking websites were only allowed to advertise the two most popular airlines, and let's say you're number 3 or 4.  The American citizens would not be informed well enough to make their traveling decisions and you would continually be the third or fourth most popular airline.  You are supporting this ideology by lending your services for free to the Commission on Presidential Debates.   You continued, ""our Senior Leaders felt that the core values of Southwest Airlines aligned with the CPD's mission of providing American Citizens the opportunity to make informed decisions.""  The Commission on Presidential Debates is limiting American citizens the opportunity to make informed decisions.  Surely, your senior leaders understand the importance of knowing as much information as possible before making the best decisions.

I call your representatives (who were completely lack luster in tone and sounded entirely apathetic towards my situation), I'm informed that my online banking was deactivated because of inactivity for security reasons, which I'm okay with, but then that I must wait 24 hours to regain access to my online banking. I kind of need to see my balance to see if I have recieved my financial aid NOW because I have Rent due, School supplies to buy, Utilities to pay for, and assignments that need to be completed ASAP of which I will not be able to complete until I can buy the necessary equipment. Maybe your over the phone representative rubbed me the wrong way, or maybe it's the continual problems I've had with your bank ranging from this, to not receiving checks that I've ordered,  to problems depositing money, to having new accounts randomly opened in my name to deposit my financial aid in rather then being deposited in to my checking account, either way, Suntrust needs to step it up. Because as of now, as soon as I graduate college and no longer need to receive financial aid, I'm switching banks."	0	1	0

The representative twice tried to tell me that I'd have to pay and send my animal underneath as she's a large dog and not a ""real"" service animal. Once I warned her that this was in direct violation of both American's policy and the American's With Disabilities Act, she took my information for the proper department to call me back ""sometime"". As I am flying over the holidays and would have to change airlines if American cannot accommodate my needs, I asked if there was a number I could call myself to sort this out - the representative instead offered to take my credit card information to change me to another airline! I understand American needs to verify the my animal is approved to fly and up to date on her records, but to be forced to wait for someone from the airline to contact me ""sometime"" to find out whether or not I can fly with the animal I need for medical reasons is simply unreasonable - especially after the dismissive attitude of your representative.

I believe there could be a much more slimline situations I believe that this should be an option in the web interface to be able to allow your customers to stop all payments at anytime and turn it on at anytime without the harassment of having to call or send faxes to validate why we want to do this!
