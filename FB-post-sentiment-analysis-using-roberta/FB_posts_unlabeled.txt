I went back with the ad and was told we do not have that promotional  packaging, we are waiting for the truck to bring more.  There was a sign back on the shelf saying that you could not mix to make up a case for this promotion.  I guess I feel taken as I usually paid $.45 per can if I bought a case.

At first they couldn't find the prescription my doctor called/sent in. After 10 minutes it was found. I explained that I have new insurance and the woman said, ""Not a problem, just bring it with you."" I asked if the prescription was ready yet and she said it would be about 10 minutes.  I arrived 20 minutes later and the prescription still wasn't ready. ""I meant 10 minutes from when I got your new insurance information."" Well she could have either A. mentioned that or B. taken it over the phone. I gave her the new information and she said the prescription would be ""Two-Fifty-Three."" I freaked and asked how five little generic pills could cost $253. She goes, ""Oh I meant it's two dollars and fifty three cents."" OK.  Fifteen minutes later my prescription is still not ready. However, a crowd has now gathered. I walked over to a tech and explained that I work in a medical facility and that one of my patients has just shown up. I explained that my privacy is critical and to please only use my first name when letting me know my prescription was ready. The tech stepped over and explained the situaiton to the tech who was calling out names.  Five minutes later that tech called me by just my first name (thankfully) but then the tech who went to ring me up used my last name. The tech I had spoken to leans over and goes, ""That was the one I said no last name!"" She replies, ""Oops!"" with a giant smile on her face.  I'm standing there very annoyed and put my other items on the counter. ""I don't think I said it THAT loud."" I didn't even have a response. She asks for my card and because I just wanted out I said I didn't have it. Usually at this point they use the store card but that would have taken effort. She rings me up and charges me full price for two items that were $10.49 each but buy one get one 50% off. I explain the sale and she begrudgingly uses the store card but it won't ring up so she manually enters a discount of $4.50 and asks for my card. ""$4.50 isn't 50% off of $10.49"" I informed her. She walks away to do the math and comes back to give the additional discount. Typically they'll round up, making my discount 75 cents but the tech did 74 cents. Not that big of a deal but it just added to my frustration.  As I walked away I approached a manger and explained this all to him. No apology, no offer to compensate me, nothing. He just nodded and said it would ""look into it."" Good to know CVS is doing so well. Guess they don't need my business."

We live in DC and vacationed in California last month. The plan was to take a military flight back home. But that was derailed because all east coast military flights were cancelled for an entire week due to a hurricane. With four of us needing to get back home quickly,  standard commercial airfare was vicious. The good news was that  our AAA travel agent was able to find a reasonable fare. So we booked the fare. But when our agent clicked to finalize the ticket purchase, the airline wouldn't accept their posted airfare. When I called the airline directly they said their website had made an ""error"" and that pricing we were quoted was ""not available"". I could, however, purchase the tickets at the standard rate.  I called the best airline in the business, Southwest Airlines. The company didn't flinch. They gave me the best pricing and even honored a military discount. The final fair was almost one third of the other airlines.  This isn't the first time I've turned to Southwest when the other airlines were unreasonable.   I like your service.

A few months ago my family was bumped from a flight - we were given travel vouchers. Now what was supposed to compensate us for a nasty experience has turned into another nasty experience  Yesterday, I called the number on the voucher to use the travel voucher for a trip on July 4. I waited 40 minutes for an agent to pick up and then gave up.  Today, I called again. I waited 17 minutes, then I was told I can not use the voucher calling the number on the voucher. Why: the flight is in less than 10 days. I asked to speak to a supervisor. I was transferred waited 10 minutes then the phone went dead. I called again after 14 minutes I got a supervisor (Michelle Smith) asked why I couldn't use the voucher. She it was because the flight was in less than 10 days. She said I would need to go my nearest airport (45 minutes away) to get a ticket using the voucher. I said quite simply . You don't mention this anywhere on the voucher, so how could I now . You left my family stranded at an airport . Now I am trying to use a voucher you provided, and you are asking to travel 90 minutes plus parking at the airport to use the voucher.  For me this is not acceptable. I asked if I could pay by credit card and then send in the voucher to get the amount of the voucher credited back to my card. She said this wouldn't work. I asked why not and she hung up on me.  Your service could be a lot better "

Shockingly now the arrival date has changed.  Your website says tomorrow and FedEx says by the 26th...neither work because as we all know Santa comes tonight.  I mean really...why say it can be there by one date and make customers pay that much for shipping if it won't arrive in time.  Now I've had to call my friend and let her know her daughter's gift will not be there tonight like it should be.  At the very least our shipping costs should be refunded to us.  I will never order from Walmart online again and you will be lucky if I ever step foot in a Walmart store again.  This is such horrible business practice especially at Christmas.

She stated that the item was ready to ship and that she couldn't cancel it.  I asked to speak with a supervisor since my account hasn't been charged and usually is when an order is ready to ship.  At 9:22am a supervisor named Ashley (she said her id # is .851141118) got on the phone.  I started to tell her the situation she kept trying to speak over me so I asked her to be please let me speak.  She did then proceeded to tell me that the item wasn't in stock and she couldn't cancel it.  I asked why it couldn't be cancelled since it was not ready to be shipped and I haven't been charged for it yet.  She told me that I only had thirty minutes after I placing an order to cancel so the item couldn't be cancelled.  I did start to interrupt to say that I was not informed when I placed the order that the item was not in stock at which time she told me to be quiet and let her finish.  She then proceeded to tell me that I need to read my emails better.  I asked to speak with her supervisor.  She told me that if I wanted to go over her head I needed to send an email.

My job as a Social Media Analyst for Fusion-io keeps me pretty fulfilled, and very busy. There's not much time for me to go out and grab something to eat, and after the... incident... that I experienced with Delissio pizza, I've effectively been banned from all ovens made by LG Electronics Canada and GE. I call it the ""Two-Hour Pizza"" incident; my previous landlord called it- well, I don't want to put that kind of language on your Facebook Wall.  But I digress.  Needless to say, when I ordered 7 of your Pure Kraft Asiago Ceasar Salads through IGA's online delivery service, I was a little skeptical. Would it come with cheese, bacon bits, AND croutons? Probably not, I figured. Yet I could see from the semi-clear sides that it did!  I resolved not to get my hopes up, though. I've been played for a sucker by pre-packaged ""food"" companies before, you see. Naturally, I knew it wouldn't come with the dressing, because multi-national companies and cutting corners, amirite? But then I opened up one of my salads to munch on as I browse the Twittersphere and lo-and-behold, there was a huge packet of dressing! Everything that I could have hoped for- everything that a man on the go could have dreamed of- was all right here in this little box. It was the kind of thing that bachelors like me can only dream of.  At least, that's what I had thought. You see, I hadn't taken the package of dressing out yet. But when I did... that's when I saw the thing that crushed me: a FORK. You put a FORK in with my salad! A friggin' FORK!  Kraft, look, I know I haven't been the best man. There's been a lot of food product purchases in my life that I've regretted. But you're not one of them.  I guess what I'm trying to say is I'm ready to take this... thing that we have... to the next level. I'm ready to commit.  I love you.  Call me?"

The man in front of me was buying 20 bottles of soda, and the older woman at the register said they have a limit. He brings her a flyer which states there is NO limit, and she calls a manager. Manager says ""well I'm not letting you buy all these, I can put a limit on them. You can buy ten, and ten only.""  He buys them and leaves. Older woman starts scanning my diapers and they are not 75% off, so I ask why. She said ""You are asking the wrong person!"" I asked her for the ""right person"".

12699262021_10151281084897022	"I just had the worst experience online with Best Buy.   Prior to 9:00 pm this evening, 8:47 to be exact, I was online ordering a cell phone upgrade (Samsung S III).  The price was 49.99.   As I proceeded to check out, the price jumped to 199.99, so I call the 888 number on the website.   The person who picked up transferred me to someone else who could assist me.  They also saw the 49.99 price and worked on gathering all my information (personal data and credit card info) and began processing it from his end, since I had hit a technical glitch.  He also experienced an issue and transferred me to sales for them to complete the process.   No one in sales picked up the phone after more than a half hour of waiting.  I called back and now the person on the other end said the sale was closed.  I found this hard to believe since it was advertised through November 24th and I expressed this to him.  He stepped away from the phone for a minute and came back and said there was nothing he could do that the sale was closed.  I requested to speak to his supervisor which he explained would tell me the same thing but I finally got someone else on the phone.  He proceeded to tell me that the sale was closed and that it was for a finite number of phones and that they were out of stock but I could purchase one for 199.99. (Steamed)  I explained to him they had all my data showing that I had called for assistance prior to 9 and that I had checked and the product was in stock.  He insisted there was nothing he could do.  I asked the person on the other end (having been on the phone for almost an hour with this process) for someone above him to speak with.  He said that I would have to email (the usual Customer No Service issue Clark Howard talks about).  I pressed for a phone number and he proceeded to hang up.  No, thank for calling I'm going to hang up now, just hung up.  He had my phone number and could have called me back if he hadn't intentionally hung up.  I'm one more customer that won't be using Best Buy again if I don't receive a call or email from them with an apology and a processing of my order.  No wonder Best Buy is having such a hard time with their bottom line.   ""Absolutely Customer No Service.""  Maybe they should change their name to Best Not Buy From Us.  "

The Cashiers, Bakery and Meat dept. are always so helpful and friendly. My last visit to Kroger left me wondering where is the service after the sale. I purchased 2 packs of baby back ribs totaling about $40, to my surprise they were spoiled! Disappointed and inconvenienced I traveled back to my Clinton Kroger ( 13.3 miles one way ) The manager John Coomes offered a refund for my ribs. I explained to him that not only was I inconvenienced but I had to travel a total of 26 miles. Mr. Coomes didn't really have much of a response other than they don't give refunds for gas. I spend hundreds of dollars in this Kroger every month ( CASH ) so it's not the money it's the principal. Having worked in customer service and management, sometimes managers have to make important customer service decisions. A $10 gift card would have satisfied me but instead I received a foolish look and somewhat of a smile. I've decided to drive two more miles to Wal Mart..... "

151262458516_10150940000928517	"I have a ""not so nice"" DG STORE experience. This happened to my mother last Saturday, July 7, in Jacksonville, Florida, Store #2404, 11018 Old St. Augustine Road, about 4:00 p.m.  My mother is a frequent shopper at this store. She is 93 years old, still very viable, lives on her own, drives her car, and shops on her own. She is not stupid, senile, or a thief! What she is, is sweet, quiet, Christian and not argumentative  Here is her DG experience:  As I said, she stopped to get several items. When she was finished shopping, she went to the cashier and checked out. The items totaled $16.44, for which she wrote a check. The young cashier made the comment that he had make a mistake and rung her purchases as ""cash"", which meant nothing to my mom, who then took her receipt and proceeded to her car. As she was placing her shopping bag in the trunk of her car, the young man came out of the store, told her that there had been a ""mistake"", and asked that she come back in the store. She agreed, although did not know why. When she got back in the store, another employee, who turned out to be the manager, asked for her receipt, then went around the store collecting duplicates of the same items. She then brought all of the items back to the counter. She asked my mother if these were the items that she had shopped for. She then AGAIN rang these items up on the cash register, placed the items in a shopping bag, arrived at the total of $16.44, and told my mother that she owed ""her"" $16.44. My mother informed her that she had already paid for these things with a check, and that they were in her trunk. The woman raised the cash drawer, saw the check, handed my mother the original receipt back, and walked off. No apology, kiss my foot, or anything else. NOW, after I learned of this totally insulting, upsetting, experience, I called the store, and spoke to the same woman, who is the manager.She admitted that she was the employee involved. I do not want to comment on the cashier himself, because my mom said he was apologetic and polite. This manager actually ""explained"" to me that all of this was necessary because they (she and the cashier"")would get into trouble if the cash register did not check up correctly. I asked over and over in many ways, what did the DG problem have to do with my mother? SHE is the customer, who shopped, paid for the items, and was trying to go about her business. It was a ridiculous conversation to say the least. Ok, now for the further update: Monday morning, July 9, I called the ""Customer Relations"" # 1-800-678-9258, and spoke to a representative. I did not want to go thru this dog-and-pony show, but I did, in order to document this problem. The DG Rep listened, and assured me that this problem would receive priority, and would be referred to the area DG District Manager, Corzell White. I even received a compliant # 1011621194. She assured me that DM White would be in touch within 3 days, up from their normal time frame of up to 6 days. This conversation was Monday morning apx. 10 am est. It is now 3:30 pm est Wednesday, July 11. No phone call. This proves to me that, 1. DG has no respect for their shoppers. They have embarrassed my elderly mom, caused her to get upset, ran her in and out the of 98 degree weather with their nonsense. and 2. DG has no respect or concern on the Corporate level. Thank Goodness for Social Media!! If you read this, please keep DG's behavior in mind, and shop somewhere else!! "

( I used other pharmacies because they filled them cheaper and some for free ) Also, they were out of my husband's heart meds on Tuesday ( gave him the only 6 they had in stock, but he takes them BID ) and said they would have the rest in on Friday. They didn't have them AGAIN yesterday! ( they control his A-fib which is scary! ) When I was upset, your employee copped a MAJOR attitude with me and told me to call the other pharmacies to ensure quicker transfer. I told him that every time I do that the other pharmacy tells me that CVS HAS to call them. ( Also, I am the customer! Not my job! ) I thought that your company would be a little happier in this rough economy to get ANY kind of business! ( Yes I am sure that MA and Medicare don't pay as much, but STILL it is business! ) We live on social security and take alot of medicine between the two of us. I do plan on writing a formal complaint on your website as well. I am sure that all of this will go unanswered, but it does make ME feel better!"

I had to wait in the car because i had 2 sleeping babies. She went in and asked someone if there was anyone who could get her photos. The first person said that wasn't there job and then turned around as if she wasn't standing there. The 2nd person said she would try to find someone but as my daughter stood there for about 5mins at the photo area she noticed the woman never left from where she was still standing. She did ask a few  more people who were walking by, but none of them would help her either. She then felt as she said (so stupid) and she left the store and returned to the car very upset and pretty sad that she couldn't get her pictures back.She is a 13 year old, very well spoken young lady and it makes me so angry that no one would help her. Needless to say i would be getting pictures there anymore or much of anything else.They do have a Wal-mart a few mins up the road. I do love to shop at Target so i guess i will just have to drive to another location thats about 15mins longer then this store.

I think the small dogs have more options for dog costumes than little dogs.  I am pleased that you guys do sale large dog costumes, and believe me we have some already ready that we bought early from Petsmart. :-)  I would like to see if you all would advocate having separate contest for small and large dog breeds.  It would be more fair in my opinion and I think there would be a greater turnout too!  Please let me know what you think. Thank you for all you guys do for saving animals' lives through your Petsmart Charities!  Keep up the great work! :-)"

Every day since then they have told me that it is on the truck for delivery and should be at my local store soon. Yesterday customer service suggested that I go to the store after work and it should be there. Well it wasn't, but they again told me that it was on the delivery truck and will be there today. I just got off the phone with Best Buy and now they tell me that my ordered has not been processed and they can't give me a delivery date. They even said I can't get one of these elusive phones from the store stock where they claim they have never been sold out because the I ordered was sent from the warehouse. As an alternative I was told I could go into the store and purchase one for the non-sale price. What a crock of BS! If I can't get a phone from the store because mine is being fulfilled by the warehouse...then tell me where does the stores get there inventory...from the warehouse. At this point I feel walking in front of the store with a picket sign. I hate being deceived and lied to by somebody that I have been a loyal customer to for years.

EG Bestbuy.com.au) She had to call up the manager to get confirmation, to which she started looking through the current Target catalogue. She hung up the phone and told me that because it wasn't in Targets catalogue you couldn't match it. She said that you only price match ""Catalogue to Catalogue"".

Four or five years ago, your store sold me a hard drive that had been repackaged as new and was missing cables when I got home. Manager accused *me* of stealing ten dollars worth of cables.  Small loss, but I resolved never to shop there again, and certainly not for anything valuable. Against all better judgment I purchased a laptop from you guys last year. Took it in a week ago to have warranty work done to fix a broken hinge. Got back a paperweight with a replaced hard drive and no OS. Strange, I never asked for any work to be done on the hard drive. And my warranty doesn't cover software?  But you'll restore it for $100?  Why thanks!  Any reputable service department always contacts the customer if it needs to do work that wasn't originally agreed upon. Why does Best Buy feel like handing me back a non-working computer is an acceptable trade when I gave them a working one? This is like my car dealership fixing a dent in the bumper, but then also replacing the ECM with no program and telling me I'll need to restore it myself.  Warranty is now up so I can't get a recovery disc with all the default software from HP either. Of course, if the Geek Squad had told me this several days ago when the work was done, I could have.

Either way, they began appearing in my inbox. I unsubscribed via the well-hidden link in the emails, but lo and behold days later I am still getting them. After unsubscribing twice, I emailed their ""Privacy Manager"" and was told that I was manually removed from the list.   Guess what, I'm still getting the emails. After a second email to the Privacy manager I was told that I had been removed but that it would take 10 days for me to stop receiving emails. Seriously? I emailed them back to inform them that this would certainly influence my desire to spend my money with them in the future.

I have (well, had) proudly flown ZERO flights on airlines not named (or affiliated with) United in over ten years.  I didn't even bother with looking at another site for flights past United.com, regardless of price, because your Mileage Plus and E+ programs WERE second to none.  My Dad has flown about a million miles on your airline, but only 700K since Mileage Plus was implemented in 1984.  We're a small family business that travels about 30K/yr for work.  Now that our Premier status seems like it will be worth about as much as Enron stock starting next week, you're forcing us to look elsewhere for an airline that might pick up where you're leaving off.  Is there one out there?  I don't know.  Are we your #1 customer?  Not remotely close.  What I do know is that your changes are giving thousands of people the thought of entertaining a switch in affiliation, which is beyond comprehension to me.  All of this for something as little as taking away E+ access at the time of booking.   Like any other industry, our family business is affected by consolidation of customers.  Our customer ""base"" is getting smaller and smaller, and we are somewhat driven by our bigger customers.  This is understandable.  However, we go out of our way to make sure that our smaller (loyal) customers feel as much appreciated as possible as our larger customers, because those are the people that put us in business in the first place.  Do they deserve or can we give them the same perks as our bigger customers? No, nor should they expect them.  I sure don't expect the same perks as your more frequent flyers.  However, I would expect that my loyalty be continually rewarded, not restricted.  It's almost like a slap in the face.   I'm sure there are THOUSANDS of loyal people out there that would agree with what I'm saying.  As a loyal customer of 10 years (and my Dad of 40+), I guess it isn't too much to ask for you to do the right thing and CONTINUE to take care of your loyal customers.  As of today, your Mileage Plus program that starts on March 3rd is not doing this.   p.s.  A business tip:  Next time, when announcing negative changes to your frequent flyer program, do it at the beginning of the year.  That way more and more people don't feel swindled by you when they continue to give you their loyalty for the entire year, to be rewarded with what you have in place starting next week.  It seems petty at best."

I made a payment online May 3rd, 2012 to pay my May 1st bill, and received confirmation of this payment. I next made a payment on May 30th to pay my June 1st bill.  Today, while logging in to make a payment for my July 1st bill, I noticed a ""return payment"" on my payment history. Then I opened a letter that stated that my account was deliquent!?  I called USBank's collection dept. and they told me that the account was 30 days late, which was traced back to the May 3rd payment that was returned due to an incorrect routing number.  My major problem here is that there was NO follow up email, phone massage, or even immediate indication online, that the payment on May 3rd did not go through.  Most banks and credit institutions have an immediate rejection notice if a number is entered incorrectly- however I received a CONFIRMATION of my payment.  In my mind, I assumed that the month of May was taken care of.  I have an excellent credit score, I make my credit payments on time EVERY month and I feel very slighted due to the US Bank's inefficient online payment system.  The online lease payment system needs obvious upgrades.  "

If you are going to be rude and snarky please keep your comments elsewhere. On my flight from the UK back to the US today I had selected an Economy Plus seat at the bulkhead (I am a Platinum elite member so this is a perk I really enjoy.) Problem started when 2 women came to take the 2 seats next to me (I was on the window) who were very very large women. (In fact BOTH of them needed a seat belt extender.) I found myself squished into half my seat, the woman next to me constantly knocking my headphones out of the plug that was on the armrest and since it was a bulkhead the tray tables were in the arm rests and give the size of these women they were taking up so much space over the armrests that there was absolutely no way I could pull out the tray table. I tried to use my computer but I had no elbow room due to the fact that the woman next to me was so overflowing into my seat with her arms etc. I know Southwest caught horrible backlash (which I personally think was completely unfair) for trying to enforce that you have to buy an extra seat (or a first class seat) if you need a seatbelt extender. What are Continental's thoughts? I talked to the flight attendant who was very sorry (and very nice too I might add) but really had no answers for me. She said I could move to another seat but it would have been a middle non-economy plus seat which in the scheme of things isn't much better.... so I kept the seat I was in. It was a very uncomfortable flight. Thoughts? Comments? Opinions? Policy knowledge?"

After sitting on the tarmac in a plane with no air conditioning, for almost an hour beyond the scheduled departure time, and being told repeatedly by the attendant and pilot that the reaon for the delay was that the plane was overbooked and overweight, we arrived in Memphis to find we missed our connection to CVG.  Not one Delta employee in Memphis was sympathic or helpful.  We were told brusquely that we were rescheduled for a flight the next morning and given a 10% coupon for a hotel.  Wow!  10% off!  When we complained, we were told since the flight was delayed due to weather, Delta didn't have to pay for our hotel.  Weather?  Wow, nice lie to get out of paying for our hotel.  We asked for the Red Coat person, who came and told us she could do nothing, which is exactly what she did. (Red Coat service is back- get excited!) I have now missed a day of work and am out the cost of a hotel room I didn't anticipate.  Next call is to the FAA to discuss the false reason for the delay given and to my corporate travel service to ask that we reconsider Delta's services in the future."

The sale representatives I spoke to suggested that I drive (or fly) to Ohio, purchase the crib, and then drive (or fly) home. That is the only solution available to me. Or, I could buy it at MY local Target store, then DRIVE the crib to Ohio. So glad Target is offering to be able to purchase ""local"" small shops merchandise from across the US at my local Target. But I can't purchase something at Target for someone in Ohio. Amazing customer service technology in use!"

179590995428478_429121980475377	"Just wanted to take a moment and thank Bank of America for making the first day of my honeymoon a real disaster.  After a beautiful wedding last weekend in Detroit my wife and I stopped over in Las Vegas to relax for a few days before heading back home to San Francisco.  We were very excited for a nice dinner, just the two of us, at a restaurant we both love.  We were very concerned to find that when we went to pay for dinner both of our debit and credit cards were shut off.  After calling the bank we found that they were closed Sunday nights and unable to help us with the predicament they caused. To make matters worse the manager of the restaurant said this happens often in Las Vegas and had a merchant line  that she often used to solve these types of problems.  Bank of America's merchant line was closed also. What good that did us.  Finally after an hour of calling family (now 2AM back east) we had to beg the manager to take a check from us and scan our ID's as added security.    I don't expect much from a bank (clearly, I'm with BoA), but when I do leave my money with someone and they cut me off I expect that they are available ANYTIME to fix the problem.  Not the case.  Disappointing. "

I went into the store last night to shop for a few things and the store was busy as always. There was only two lanes open (one regular lane and 20 items or less) with lines of people waiting to check out. There was tons of workers on the floor but the managers wouldn't bring any body to the registers. The store was a mess with shelves empty and items everywhere. There were workers just standing around talking with each other instead of helping customers. There was about five different people at the jewerly counter when the lady was ringing up a lady. Once she was done with that customer she walked away and left the rest of the customers at the counter and when she was asked for help she just looked at them and she was on break and walked away. A customer had to track down another employee who was also rude. I don't know if your corperate people every visit this store but they really need too. I always see them at other walmart stores. I think the managers need to take a training course at the other walmart stores to see how to manager a store right. I will not be back to this store.

92979593115_10151176974918116	"On Friday September 29th my husband took me to the emergency room because I was sick.  After spending several hours there we needed to get a prescription filled, since it was the middle of the night we went to the CVS that was probably about a half a mile away from the hospital.  My husband waited in line for about 20 minutes, behind a woman and her son.  The one person taking in prescriptions was trying to figure out some dosing/charges for these people.  The customer had a hospital bracelet on too and who knows how long they kept her standing there, plus this woman had driven from another city to this specific location because they were supposed to have what she needed.    After this 20 minutes of waiting I asked one of the other women in the pharmacy, that had helped at least three people check out and pick up prescriptions, if someone else could take my script so my husband didn't have to wait in line anymore.  She told me ""no, that is where we take in prescriptions"" pointing to where my husband was waiting.  I was very sick and wanted my medicine so I could start to feel better.  After about a minute more I went over and told my husband ""Come on we are going to Walgreens."" So, we turned around and began walking toward the exit.  The woman that had denied she was able to help us in the first place began following us and said ""excuse me, I'm available to help you now.""  Uh, no thanks ""we are going to Walgreens.""  She had just told me no one else could help us.  And let me tell you that the woman and her son were still standing at the counter being 'helped' by the other woman.    Walgreens is just about three miles away, not really that far to drive, but when it is after midnight and you just got out of the ER and you are sick, you don't want to have to drive the extra distance.  And we shouldn't have had to.  The sad thing?  This particular CVS has always been slow; from the time they opened.  When they first opened I thought it was just because they were training and new, nope.  It never got better.  It doesn't matter what time of the day it is, you have to stand at the counter for at least 10 minutes while they take in your prescription and then wait.  I have never had a prescription done quickly there and generally when they say it will be done in 20 minutes, it takes 40 or more.  I have never been to another CVS to fill a prescription, so I am not sure if this is a problem with all of them or just this particular location.    So you know how long it took us to get the medicine from Walgreens?  Less thank 5 minutes.  Guess where we won't be going for prescriptions any more?  CVS on First Colonial Road, maybe all of them.  Just because they are the only pharmacy open in a specific location does not mean that the employees can make you wait that long.  I am disappointed by the service, or lack of service we received from your associates, I'm not entirely sure I will ever go back to any locations, because lets face it; there are many other pharmacies I could go to."

We trusted the cedar bluff store in Knoxville, Tn to put these speakers in and had assured us they knew what they were doing. My dad picked up the vette and the speakers sounded great. He then took it to Reeder Chevrolet who deals with corvettes and upon inspection of the dash discovered that it was damaged. Reeder did not remove the dash or repair the air conditioner because of the issue and recommend it be replaced. When my father talked to best buy we learned the gut who installed the speakers had not worked on an old vette before and after describing how he removed it we learned he removed the dash improperly. Best but turned it into their insurance and washed their hands of the issue with no apology or admittance of wrong doing. The insurance company of course denied the claim and now we are stuck with repairs far greater then the speaker costs. My father who was just diagnosed with cancer and was a former High School football coach and teacher in this community doesn't have the time right now to fight this. But I do! Shame on you Best Buy.

Yet those of us who have Saving account with overdraft or other overdraft protection get slammed with fees. Choose not to have the option and save big dollars. Why are those with money in savings account forced to pay a fee when a deadbeat can get away with paying nothing. And yes I am right because I have a kid in college who BOA allows to use his debit card when there is no money in it and he is not charged unless he goes 5 days without covering it. Yet mom and dad who forget about a small debit get charged $10 to transfer it from our savings. As usual those who follow the rules get SCREWED. FYI this is for debit card transactions not insufficient check fees. BOA is not supposed to authorize the debit if there is not money to cover it but yet they do

However, I was not able to do that at Target today in Levittown, NY, specifically - - I could not use a manufacturer's coupon for $3.00 off ten Smart Ones if I wanted the $5.00 gift card promotion.  I don't think this is right at all.  The store is reimbursed the amount of the manufacturer's coupon and using a manufacturer's coupon should have nothing at all to do with a store promotion.  I contacted customer relations by phone since I could not get through by e-mail and was given a reference number to bring back to the store so that they would honor the coupon.  The customer relations representative was very nice.  However, I don't think there should have been a problem to begin with!  Still, I LOVE Target!"

I would suggest that people not buy from best buy and buy from other companies that d stand by their product warranty.

117497138610_10151107050728611	" Attention walgreens shoppers: After a grooling 50 minutes on the phone with customer support regarding missing points I have been informed that a customer cannot use a PURCHASED gift card to pay for their order and still get reward points. I am sure there are hundreds of people out there with receipts proving this information inaccurate. But a heads up on what you are dealing with. I was told by the cusomer support person (nick), 2 supervisors (peggy and jeanie) and was confirmed by the actual trainer (Chris G) (through Peggy) that you cannot use a gift card to pay and receive points. Of course my reciept in question awarded me 1,000 points and the only explanation for that was 'I shouldn't have received those'.   Here is what happened, on Sunday I purchased 2 mitchum and received 4,000 points (should have been 2,000). On Saturday I purchased several mitchum (and several other items) and paid with my gift card (not in store credit or merchandis e return, but bought and paid for regular gift card). I received 1,000 points for this transaction instead of 1,000 for each mitchum. I knew walgreens had changed the points from 2,000 to 1,000 (correcting their error as it is advertised as 1,000 points), I didn't know that they had made it a limit of 1 per transaction as there wasn't anywhere stating this in my store. During my call I was placed on hold numerous times and the conclusion is that it is in walgreens traning manual (and verified by the trainer) that you cannot use a walgreens gift card and get points. The 1,000 points I received couldn't be explained. Of course in my mind, I know that they are wrong, the gift card had nothing to do with only getting 1,000 points. The real reason was that they had changed the limit. Frustrating to say the least. Walgreens consumers shouldn't know more than the people walgreens employ to offer customer support.   If anyone else has used a gift card to pay and received points or bought more than one mitchum with cash/check/debit and only got 1,000 points please let them know. They need to train staff better!  Or if they are accurate, they need to put it in their terms and conditions and explain why I magically got 1,000 points.  Frustrating to say the least.  "

I cannot sell my house, due to the fact I'll have to pay $50,000 or more to sell it, I can't rent my house because the rent doesn't even cover the monthly payment, therefore we'd be taking a loss every month, I am trying to do the right thing by short selling our home, but you all are making it very difficult!  We have made it to Phase 2 of the short sale process which is waiting for an offer to get approved and then waiting to close on our house. I have had to call you nonstop for 3 months to even get this far.  We have listed our house at the price YOU requested, and have received 3, yes, THREE full price offers within 4 days of listing our house.  We then submitted it to you and now, it has been 2, yes, TWO weeks and we have not heard anything.  I have called multiple times, and left multiple messages with my Phase 2 negotiator, and have received zero phone calls back. I have emailed her also and no reply. I have even contacted her manager and left a message, and still received no call back.  I was then informed there was no one else that could help me besides these two individuals.

I was then told that my ""negotiator"" was busy negotiating our loan, BUT, our offers were FULL price, and one is pre-approved for a loan with YOU, therefore there is NOTHING to ""negotiate""!!!!!!!!!  I am very frustrated and feel as if you all are purposely dragging your feet with this so you won't have this short sale on your record and pass us off to the next bank.  I have been calling you every week since we started this process, and I intend to stop at nothing to get this short sale done and over with.  Bank of America you have met your match! I am a very determined individual, and I will take this to my state senator and I will take this to anyone who will listen. I will even get a lawyer if I have to, because I deserve answers, not just silence.   You all have screwed enough people and I will NOT be one of them!!!  So this is my letter to you letting you know that I will not stop, and that I expect you to treat me as a person and not as a piece of paper or file on your desk.  Sincerely,  Kelly Sutliff (Your Nemesis)"
199504650087085_300480599989489	"From the get go, this has been the worst traveling experience I have ever had. Leaving home at 515 in the morning I checked united.com and our flight to chicago was arrived and on time. At 6am at CLE the flight suddenly was no longer available, and the attendant completely changed our flight to las vegas first on united, then we would fly delta first class from vegas to LAX to honolulu. Deal and done, good job united. Except for it wasn't a deal apparently. Upon getting to LAX we don't have any tickets to honolulu, all of sudden we have to walk across LAX to go to united to talk to customer service, delta says united messed up and they can't help. upon getting to customer service and tell then the story so far, they say there is nothing they can do. Mind you we are stranded in LAX now. we ask for a manager, silence, no managers, ""call customer service""this is so messed up at this point has no idea what is going on, the original itinerary can't be located. This is two hours of us trying to figure out how we get out of LAX. Go to the united club to find a manager, tell the story again, she says we have to leave the club while they work on this. Excuse me? We are stranded 2000 miles from home, no idea where are bags are, and we cannot wait in the lounge while united staff fixes a problem that their own staff created. You have the worst customer service I have ever experienced in any industry. There are multiple cases of passing the buck amongst staff and rude behavior. The very fact I must log a complaint via facebook, twitter, and the internet is incredibly rediculous and inconvenient when traveling. The lack of empathy shown by your LAX staff boggles the mind. I will continue to relay this story on social media and via email until this has been rectified to my satisfaction. I look forward to a response for this wholly inappropriate corporate response to a situation wholly created by united. Sincerely, Dr. bryan wesolowski. P.s. I had to write this via cellphone as I'm still stranded 2000 miles from home in LAX, without my baggage, and on the floor. Since the lounge is only for ""paying customers"""

125472670805257_506879729331214	Delta here is an example of why a lot of people dislike airlines. My flight to Mexico City was cancelled yesterday. When I eventually got a call back 4 hours later I found a date that I would retake my trip only to find out that there would be a change fee due to me not being able to fly within 7 days. The flight that I wanted was a few $ less than the one I had. However Delta was going to charge me over $400 to change to this flight. Since there was no cancellation fee due to the weather I was able to book exactly the same flight that the agent was offering me online and then asked her to just cancel my current itinerary.  Can you please explain to me why you would offer a customer an option that is more than $400 more expensive for the same date / time & flight? If there was an option to give a customer exactly the same options for less money why would you not do that?

I just spent 15 minutes on the phone with customer service trying to figure out why I received no MQM bonus on my last flight.  That's very misleading terminology..."

For the inconvenience, here's a 20% pass.  First, how is that any consolation, especially since I received three 20-25% MVC passes in yesterday's mail.  Second, apparently MVC means nothing because customer service is terrible regardless of how much business a person gives you.  Third and most important, the e-mail says I will receive a separate e-mail with specifics about the cancellation.  Is the ""separate e-mail"" the one had I received on Tuesday cancelling the item I ordered on Monday?  Or is it cancelling one of the six items I ordered on Sunday?  No other Kohls e-mail came after the sweet (not) consolation e-mail.  In addition, when I called customer service on Wednesday about the item that was cancelled from Monday's order the rep told me that the item is definitely not discontinued, it's just backordered.  Hmmm, sounded like a crock because why would my item not just be put on backorder!  She insists it will be available and I just need to do the work and keep checking the website and call them when it's available again so they can honor the price I was supposed to pay.  She said it will most likely be available again after this weekend once they have time to restock.  I keep checking; I hope she wasn't lying because I will be quite upset that I passed up paying only $10 on Amazon (for a flip waffle iron) to get it from Kohls instead for a few dollars more with the thought that it would be easier to return if it didn't work.  My instincts tell me this will be a lesson learned, no more online purchases from Kohls.  Makes me want to go back and look just how much I've spent there over the years!"

Lost in reading, I didn't plan on someone else's hot coffee being spilled down my entire right side. The dark haired flight attendant with the empty coffee cup was now noticeably agitated that I hadn't expected it!  She was quick to lecture me regarding her ""training for emergencies"" and how to keep the cold, wet napkins on my overheated arm even though I needed to mop up all the liquid. Her ""sincere"" apology was several minutes later, followed by a snarky comment under her breath as she passed by.

Accidents certainly happen, but it was Ms. Dark Hair's agitated attitude that should have been prevented. There are indeed choices when it comes to air travel today."

On leaving the USA i was told there would be no problem getting my money in south africa - that was the most incorrect statement ever made!  It is now 1 year later and after a lot of money spent on phone calls, notarization of documents, dhl fees i have managed to get half my money!  The person that eventually helped in that instance - Mr Eli Rodriguez in Miami - now tells me that he cannot assist me anymore and i must deal with the call centre.  Every person i talk to at the call centre tells me something different.  After being told the only way to get my money is to close the account and request a cashier's cheque to be mailed to me which in this day + age of electronic banking i find ridiculous but as no other viable option was given to me, i instructed Crystal at the call centre to do exactly that.  I was gen a reference number and was told that an email would be sent confirming the instruction and the cheque would be mailed to me - this was on 28 Sept - no email, no cheque!  On phoning the wall centre once more, talking to more than one person for over 30 min at my cost - i was told the instruction was on the system but someone?! Decided that the amount was too much and cancelled the transaction.  Now i have been told to send a letter of instruction notarized by the us embassy to a p o box address.

8103318119_10151177073388120	"I just wanted to let someone know about my HORRIBLE experience with my interview process at the new Target in Madison, Alabama.  I called to see if anyone reviewed my application and resume (I have 8 and a half years retail management) and was told to come in for an interview the next day by a lady named Selina.  I went in and interviewed with the Store Team Lead and another person.  They told me they were busy so this was going to count as the first two interviews.  The interview seemed to go well and they told me that they were going to call me back for a third interview.  A couple of weeks go by and I call to see if I was going to get a call back and Selina tells me yet again to come in for my third interview the following Monday.  This now makes the second time I have had to call and check on the status of my application.  The third interview goes well and the person I interviewed with, her name was Christine, tells me that it looks like I am ahead of the other applicants and that I would make a great fit for Target.  However, when she approaches Selina, Selina tells me to give them ANOTHER week because they have to interview all applicants.  By the next Monday this makes 1 month that I have been going back and forth with this interview process and not knowing anything and this is ridiculous.  I was a Customer Service Manager for 6 years and have done exactly the job they are doing and I would NEVER drag something like hiring a new applicant out over this long of a period.  Friday comes and I receive an e-mail stating that I wasn't selected.  I called and spoke to Carrie (I believe that is what her name is) and ask why I received this email when I was told that I would be called and she told me that they haven't made a decision yet and that they would be making it on Monday and that she would personally call and let me know something since I interviewed with her the first time.  So I was told to disregard this email.  I might add that I have had friends with similar situations and went through the same obstacles with Target.  Monday comes and I haven't received a call.  Late Monday I decide to call and ask for Selina.  Someone tells me that she is out sick and they don't know when she will be back.  I was told that Carrie was in meetings all day and she would call me back the next day.  I decide to go in to the store and ask for Selina on Tuesday.  This time I am told that she is on vacation that whole week and won't be back.  Now I am starting to wonder why I am getting told two different stories.  The team lead I spoke with told me that he was drug tested the same day that he had his third interview and that a third interview usually means you got the job and he didn't understand what was going on in my situation.  He told me that he would have Carrie call me when she got back from a meeting in Birmingham.  A few hours pass and I'm still feeling frustrated so I decide to call Target back.  This time I actually talk to Selina (whom I was told was sick and then on vacation).  She tells me that they chose someone else.  She didn't give me a reason why and she wasn't going to call me and let me know.  I kept getting the run around and wasted over a month of my time with this job.  This was a horrible experience.  I was told great things about Target but this is making me reconsider employment opportunities there.  I believe how I was treated is unacceptable."

She drove to Terre Haute from Sulliva, IN to try to get the meds cheaper...the girl working the counter tried to use different discount codes to get it as cheap as possible (since they have no INS) & it was still going to be $32.00 the grandmother only had $12.00 to her name...after telling  the girl working the counter it's for a baby that has a double ear infection that just left the ER she still couldn't get the price any cheaper, I asked if they still can split up prescriptions & just get a few days worth which they can but not on liquids...finally the clerk (Amanda) told the lady to give her the $12 & she was going to put the rest on her on debit card so the lady could get her grand babies meds...""it's Christmas time she said to the lady"" who then turned around to me and shook her head with her eyes filling up with tears.

By deceptive I do not mean that the offer is a scam, its not. What I mean is that they tried to pull a ""fast one"" on me and trick me into giving my consent to be enrolled. Essentially, they wanted me to give permission for them to send on offer via mail and if I did not reply by October 26th I would automatically be enrolled and pay for the coverage. They did not explicitly explain what I just said. Luckily I was paying attention, and after asking deeper questions, was able to get them to admit this. Point is, if you receive a phone call requesting permission to send you an offer in the mail, unless you would like the coverage, do not give permission. If you fail to respond in time they will charge you... US Bank has resorted to cheap telemarketing tactics."
21493231379_10150684785571380	"In May 2010 we received a double blow, learning my husband was terminally ill, as well as having a stall in our business. I called Discover to give them advance warning that finances were going to be in turmoil for a few months.  I had been a loyal customer for 12 years, but when I called them, none of that mattered.  They were unwilling to waive any monthly payments, refused to accept partial payments, refused to close the account, filed a lawsuit and is now saying they've put a lien on my property.  After twelve years of relationship!   It took me only five months to resolve our business to work without my husband, so he could focus on end-of-life care. By October 2010 we were back on financial track, just as I'd promised them we would be.  We could have easily started paying the full monthly payments again, but they refused, demanding triple the amount, the full balance or nothing. Still they refuse to work with me, saying ""it's in the attorney's hands,"" all the while the attorney says, ""we can only do what Discover tells us to do.""   I do not mind paying interest for the privilege of using credit. We never begrudged Discover for it, and never attempted to get out of what we owe.  I continue to pay a monthly payment despite their daily calls, visits to my door, and their entirely ludicrous instructions for my husband to ""just go get a job"".    What is truly ironic is that prior to all of this we were in the middle of refinancing our mortgage, which would have allowed us to pay off all our debts, when Discover-without warning, cause or explanation-reduced our available credit lines down to the existing balances.  Without spending a dime, we were suddenly maxed out, which dropped our credit score down to a point we no longer qualified for the refinance.    So what has my 12 years of loyalty earned me? First a trashed credit score for no reason, then a lawsuit, and now a property lien.  That is not exactly the ""rewards program"" they advertise!  "

Given that I needed a last minute anniversary card by tomorrow I thought of 2 options: 1) Buy one when I get off work at 5pm or 2) Create one the night before at Walgreens.com and pick it up in the early morning before my commute out. I went with the latter and took the time to create a photo calendar and card that had a pick up time of 7:00am. I selected a store that promised me a time of 7:00am, even if it wasn't my first choice, because the locations near my home and work would not have it ready until the next day. I finalized my purchase, paid the charges, and then called in to ensure that my order was ready by 7am or at least 7:30am. The manager told me that it couldn't be ready until 9am because their system was offline and by the time it came on they would already have been closed. I asked how he could help me since I paid for my order and was promised a specific time and he told me to call the other stores. I called the stores in my neighborhood and no one could assist me. Now I'm stuck with a charge on my card, a good couple hours wasted from creating these projects, and a pick up time that could not be honored properly. If it wasn't for an anniversary I wouldn't be upset, but I do have to say that this inconvenience was a little more than irritating because, while it's not the end of the world, I have to go and buy another card despite the time, effort, and money I wasted with Walgreens. I'm a loyal, frequent customer so I thought to share this experience and ask how this could be fixed or at least compensated for. Thank you for your time!"

I am so appauled that they looked at her and told her No, even after saying there wasnt any other handicapped restroom available, please pass this along to everyone you know because this is downright shamful"
125472670805257_355735714445617	"The following is a complaint I submitted to Delta concerning a recent experience.  It will be interesting to see if I get a response and if Delta cares anything about customer satisfaction or loyalty.  I paid full fare for a flight to my Grandmother's funeral.  I called about a bereavement fare and was offered a fair $125 dollars higher than the internet posted fair.  That is a fantastic way to show compassion to Delta customers who are in a stressed and saddened time in their life.  Once again, the airlines seem to care of nothing but the bottom dollar considering the flights I boarded were not full.  After arriving at my destination airport (Philadelphia) I learn that my baggage (containing my suit, toiletries, dress shoes, clothing, and other things I need for the funeral) was delayed.  I am informed at the Philadelphia Delta Baggage office that my bag will be delivered between 10 and 11 am the next day.  I am writing this complaint at 12:15pm (the next day) when I can still not be accurately informed by Delta when to expect my bag.  My wife and I have been one 27 (one-way) flights since January 2011 of which 12 (one-way) flights are international.  Living in Calgary, CA we make it a point to give our business to American carriers such as Delta versus carriers like WestJet and Air Canada.  I deserve to have my baggage fee refund for this flight, waived for my flight home, and provided a voucher to encourage me to fly with Delta (of which I am a very long patron) ever again.  I look forward to hearing a response to this request and am also posting this complaint on public networking websites directly linked to Delta Airlines.  Thank you. "

Next she arrives at the airport very early, she is notified the flight will leave until 12:00 in the afternoon, because the early flight is already oversold. Finally it was time for departure and a man reaches her and tells her, she is seated in his seat!  How come a serious airline does something like that?  By the time she arrived at Houston the AA crew at the airport tells her she is supposed to pay for a hotel room, because it was her fault and not AA fault that her flight was cancelled. As far as I recall, when an Airline needs to cancel a flight, they are supposed to pay for everything the people from that flight need, including hotel accomodations.

Although we had a great conversation today, it was sad to see how beat down these employees are in dealing with the fall-out from this merger.  Yesterday's IT mess was just another blow to employee morale.  When I asked if they had recovered, they both welled up with tears and frustration.  They had endured so much verbal abuse from frustrated travelers with NO support from UA.  Essentially no communication from UA to the field staff left them like shark bait in the water.  While I never excuse rude behavior, it is easy to see where the recent increase in poor customer service and behavior is coming from.

From my Mom thinking that I am going to hit the car in front of me to the passenger who thinks that I should have taken another route.  I wake up early every morning to make it to work on-time and just one moron on the freeway can cause me to be late - even though I preplanned my time to prevent being late.  I remind myself that in the air passengers and crews are the same...  Passengers can easily look out the window of a terminal, window of a plane and see the weather is perfect so why is the delay due to weather?  Crew members are all on board, pilots are in their seats ready to go, but what we don't see is that paperwork is missing, the fuel truck is running behind, the flight attendant has found a mistake during her preflight check...  All of the demographics of the air industry depends on an abundance of things...  A trickle affect.  ALL AIRLINES start their day with an on-time attempt at success.  I do agree that customer service has failed in an array of services that we deal with on a day to day basis.  I think that there must be some patience in today's travel, whether by bus, train, or plane....  Take your approach to a comforting level and don't always allow your frustrations get the best of you.  I do believe that the employees do realize that you are depending on them to get you where you need/want to go, I just think that we often feel our own issues are more important because hard earned money and time is being spent on something that does not always appear to be as important to others as it is to ourselves...  This is a service based industry and mistakes are going to happen...  Service based companies do experience human error and as much as I know the hiring process of large companies, it is never 100% guaranteed that who is hired is going to give 100% excellent customer service, unfortunately..."

I would suggest that all the United executives grab a bottle of good scotch and gather around the executive conference room table to share in the reading of this missive.  The following will not be pretty.  (Oh, on a related note, it is abundantly clear that the risk averse folks that run the public relations mill for United are the entity in charge of your Facebook site.  They will not know what to do with this posting.  You might want to consider moving management of your social media interactions to a team that has the capabilities to do the job.) As a twenty year flier of United, I am accustomed to foibles and mishaps in the comings and goings of my flights and associated transactions.  I am not accustomed to wholesale failure and abject disregard for customers.  It is evident that the when the first core team was assembled to put together the post-merger integration plan between  UA and Continental, the war room was filled with shout outs for flight rationalization, equipment consolidations, and back-office efficiencies.  What is also frighteningly clear, is that line #1 of the MS Project Plan read as follows:  ""Send SWAT team to find the SVP of Customer Experience and the CMO; apprehend; lock both in a vault for 12 months""  I say this as it is the only feasible explanation for how a brand conscious entity as United could so categorically go about its merger with Continental and delivery of new ""services"" in such a way as to so thoroughly skewer its customers.    How in the name of the Friendly Skies it is possible that some executive actually signed off on the use of the old Continental ecommerce/transaction platform as the new  United web presence?  Frankenstein was a more beautiful assembly of an abomination of parts.  I thought ""user unfriendly"" was a Web 1.0 turn of phrase.   The insults do not stop there.   Have a concern and wish to speak to someone at Customer Care?  You will need to use the wonderful new avatar customer service genie known as ""Alex"" on the website.  She pops up there and the call center voice over takes you to her after you have yelled ""help"" into your handset 11 times.  That you might want to actually discuss a matter that does lend itself to a FAQ is inconceivable.     If Alex cannot find the answer, she suggests you fill out a form.  Real time chat is only reserved for those moments when you are engaged in commerce and there is a concern that you might step away from completing a transaction.  Mr.  Smisek, please stop listening to the aforementioned PR team.  Despite the apparent direction given by the PR group that you should tape a series of videos to be played on each flight, I would suggest you cease and desist from such efforts as the videos only reinforce the image of a distant executive, acutely unaware of the seething dislike of his company by erstwhile long-time customers.  I do not wish to shake your hand as you suggest upon finding me on a flight.  I am not interested in your pontifications of how wonderful your new fleet of aircraft is.  You and your operations minions have made it far more difficult for me to do business with you.  I am exhausted, frustrated, and looking for the old company that actually gave a damn about its customers. I know things are really bad because I am encountering a completely new demeanor from your line employees.  They no longer attempt to explain United's policies, they no longer endeavor to empathize with my concerns and find a solution.  They, too, are exhausted.  To a man and a woman, do you know what they say?  ""I would encourage you to write a letter.  They do not listen to me (stunning for me to hear them actually say that).  They will listen to you.""  Your own people have lost faith. Mr. Smisek, I understand that the market and the long-haul model have forced your hand and those of certain other competitors to rethink how to do business.  However, in the throes of optimizing booking algorithms, determining the price elasticity of a seat in an emergency aisle or one with limited recline, burying access to 800 #s on your website,  and the like, you have forgot something:  people like to do business with people who are likeable.  United is not likeable. So, what do you stand for and what are you going to do about it?  "

Attempted to use my 5% cash back for a trip. The site didn't work; claimed it was the hotel's fault. To keep a long story short, Discover don't want to take ownership of there ""5% cash back program"". It's not the money, just the principal of Discover's program, Discover's site not working, and Discover's lack of ownership to this issue instead of passing me around through agent to agent and still no answer."

179590995428478_420575204663388	"I spoke with the initial mortgage originator when I purchased my property.  I explained my situation as well as my frustration with BOA (the plethora of mundane administrative requests to confirm my assets and not communicating with me before or on the day of closing that I was not to close).  I've wasted more personal time than necessary and a vacation day that can not be replaced.      They've offered me an estimated 3.5% interest rate and a free home inspection (since I already paid BOA for that service).  They are diligently performing the necessary research to confirm the 3.5% rate by the end of the business day.  This potential decrease from 4.0% (offered by BOA) to an estimated 3.5% is worth waiting an additional 45-60 days to close.  I will let you know the confirmed interest rate as soon as it becomes available.  Hopefully BOA can match or beat it.  If not, as a customer of BOA for 8 years with a credit score as high as mine who has faithfully made every credit card and mortgage payment on time, I will do everything possible to ensure the mortgage is not ultimately sold to BOA.  Additionally, my BOA credit card will be canceled.   I've worked in customer service for many years and am the Customer Complaint Manager for a regional entity of one of the largest German multi-national companies in the world.  I utilize Net Promoter Score (NPS) and various Customer Relationship Management (CRM) tools on a daily basis, so I know first hand how valuable customer satisfaction is to the pipeline of profitable growth.  Negative experiences (cases like this) are treasures because they can highlight where an organization needs improvement.  BOA has an opportunity to keep me as a client, if they so choose.    "

When my Insignia NS-L32Q09-10A gets connected to a Windows 7 computer, the initialization process tells the computer that Insignia unit is both a monitor and a pair of amplified stereo speakers.  The initialization string needs to be a little less literal; it needs to claim the Insignia is both a monitor and a set of 5.1 amplified speakers.  Make that string a download, so I can shift it via USB flash-drive to service port on TV.

12699262021_10151282450342022	"Dear Best Buy, I have bought a few TV's from you. My main TV is a Dynex That I drove 100 miles(each way)to pick up when I lived in Missouri) and I have a smaller Insignia in my lounge(which I bought more recently after I moved to Iowa and closer to a Best Buy).  I had hoped to upgrade my main TV to a Passive 120hz LG TV which I purchased online to pick up at the Waterloo store.  When I got there they brought up a 2D LG TV.  I showed the online pickup girl on the receipt where it said it was 3D.  She called over the manager who offered to return the 2D tv and sell me the 3D one I had already ordered and paid for for $200 more. He also offered me a worse TV at the price I had already bought the better TV for.  I didn't want to be upset in store so I left without the 2D TV that I did not order(or the 3D TV that I did order for that matter)  I then spent an hour on the phone with 1-888-bestbuy, I was mostly bounced around from one department to another, because really what department deals with ""I bought one TV, they gave me another, than tried to sell me the one I ordered for $200 more?""  The worst was when the lady on the phone said there was nothing she could do for me and I should just order the TV I want if I didn't like the one I got and exchange it(when I had already ordered the TV I wanted).  So I asked if there was anyone else I could talk to, and she said, ""My superior visor is on break and won't be back for 2 hours""(this is after she told me her ""superior visor"" was too busy helping lots of other customers to talk to me).  I may only live 40 miles away now, but that's still quite a trek to basically get shafted by your company and then get really REALLY poor customer service.  I'm just baffled as to how bringing out the wrong TV then offering to sell me the one I already paid for and had a receipt for is not the exact definition of a ""Bait and Switch"".  This is by far the worst experience I've ever had shopping and I'm really disappointed in your company. "

313163945066_10151159560455067	" Dear US Bank: Here's a copy of a letter I'm sending to President Obama, congresspersons, and anyone else for whom I can afford a stamp. Enjoy:  Since the banking and housing fiasco that contributed to our nation's current, ongoing economic crisis, I (and others like me) have watched my wages be frozen, my home value decrease, and the cost of living steadily rise as I forego such things as self-care, home repairs, and other necessities. I used to keep my credit card in my ""important paper box,"" where it remained untouched until this year, when I was forced to use it for day-to-day living expenses like food, transportation to and from work, and prescriptions.   In the past three years, I have contacted US Bank several times to request some sort of loan modification; I sent them paperwork showing how my home value and the property condition of my home have decreased since 2004, when I purchased my home. I gave them an itemized list of my monthly expenses (mortgage, utilities, and car and insurance payments) that showed I have $150 or less each month to spend on groceries. But, as they have in the past, US Bank denied by application because ""I had not provided evidence of financial hardship."" When I contacted US Bank to ask them what about having $150 or less a month to spend on groceries didn't show evidence of a financial hardship, I was told that I was not delinquent on my house payment. In other words, because I've charged up my credit cards and gone without in order to pay my mortgage on time and preserve my credit rating--and because US Bank is more than happy to collect the interest on overpriced mortgages-- I'm out of luck?  People know that cars decrease in value the moment they're driven off the lot, but they don't buy homes with the same expectation! Owning a home was the now defunct American Dream whereby we could investment in the future. Sadly, many of us have lost or are losing our futures; the banks got  bailouts.   US Bank is willing to let me refinance my home if I pay them between five thousand and seven thousand dollars in closing costs, but, in all good conscience, how can I or anyone give the banks even more money for properties already worth much less than what's owed on them, and through no fault of our own?   Please, Mr. President. Surely there is something you can do?  Sincerely,   Michelle Moore "

Kroger always seems to carry the oddball items that are necessary for our family dinners, having people with food allergies and for that I am grateful. I cannot imagine having Thanksgiving dinner this year and having to tell certain members of my family that they are stuck with plain salad again because I couldn't make accomodations due to a lack of specialized ingredients allowing me to prepare a gluten, milk, and egg free meal. :( Closing Kroger in the town of Louisiana will be heartbreaking and, in my opinion, a mistake. To my knowledge, Kroger is the only place in the town where baby formula and baby food can be bought. With the economy as slow as it is in our area, I personally know a lot of people who have had to put off getting vehicles fixed or have had vehicles reposessed, who also have small children and babies. Finding someone willing to give you a ride to a town 15 minutes away to get formula is so much harder than finding a ride across town especially when you've got a baby due for a feeding any moment. Kroger is the only grocery store in the town and therefore the only carrier of fresh fruits, veggies, and meats. Without this store, more people will resort to going to Dollar General and purchasing processed, bagged, and frozen foods, as well as empty calorie junk food to feed their families and children, teaching kids bad eating habits and contributing to the skyrocketing obesity rates. Please reconsider. To a lot of folks, closing Kroger in Louisiana, Missouri, would be a mistake.

Your page getting flooded with upset customers over the last few days proves I'm not alone.

Their only 'proof' of this lunacy will be a few out-of-context quotes from 10-15 years ago. Mostly these comments are coming  either from supporters of mechanized assembly-line livestock production or from mega-volume pet breeders who will tell you that your dachshund is actually 'livestock'...like a pig or a goose, to be treated as such. Pay them no mind..they have all sworned on the bible that animals are their 'property', like a coffee-table, and  have been ranting like this since the undercover livestock abuse videos began showing up and  the HSUS began pushing back at pet-millers. Simply put, they do not want to spend the extra bucks to reduce livestock and companion animal suffering Thanks again for your support of some great causes!!!"

I placed an order online on December 1st, received only two items on Thursday the 9th, and the rest of my order, besides an item you so conveniently didn't tell me was cancelled UNTIL it was too late to add a different one to my order, was supposed to be delivered yesterday. I hop on UPS tracker and find out that my shipment has been returned to sender due to the wrong address? HOW IS THIS POSSIBLE when all the items in my order were paid for and all the data was received at the same time?! Giving you the benefit of the doubt, I called your ""Customer Service"" line only to wait 13 minutes to even speak to someone and when finally ""greeted"", it was by someone who; #1- I could not understand, despite my hardest efforts, #2- acted as if I was ruining HIS day by asking him to DO HIS JOB, & #3- told me that there was nothing he could do, that it was UPS's fault and that I needed to contact them when it was CLEARLY a error made by TARGET! After being placed on hold ANOTHER 7 minutes to ""verify information"", I was told that I need to wait until tomorrow to call UPS since they are closed today and also waste another day while my package makes its way back to headquarters.

Not all people can afford to change their flights to an earlier date merely because Delta is unwilling to plan for an inevitable, and very easily-predictable, weather event.  I'm sure you have very smart people who could figure out some sort of plan, if you become willing to do so.  Good luck, and please update your passengers accordingly.

7003656077_10150562399361078	"American airlines bait & switch shuffling of our RT flights from Boston to Tortola caused my son to miss an important test at school (the flight I booked was scheduled to leave after school), the next flight out of JFK was changed & then delayed (weather was not an issue). Coming  back the 1 hour layover in JFK was changed to a 3 hour layover layover so instead of getting home at 2:55 we are scheduled to get home @ 6:05, making our travel home from Tortola a full 23 hours so in addition to missing the test & spending hours traveling to a destination that is only 5 hours away we will also have to pay another night's board for our dog. Today, When our flight from Puerto Rico arrived early my husband sprinted over to see if he could snag a seat on the 12:20 flight to Boston he was first told that he would have to pay a fee - to which he said ok- and then he was told there were no seats? Why is American Allowed to delay our flights with no return of funds to us- we paid $1,000 per ticket- but then  demand payment when we try & get on an earlier flight & only then say that actually there are no seats available? Could it be that the gate agent just didn't want to hassle with changing my husband's ticket? I used to be a gold member AA flier, but I haven't flown American much in the past few years due to an abundance of instances like this: poor scheduling, poor customer service, high cost & miserly conditions in coach (our flight this morning had a broken video system & no blankets). I would like a return of $50 per ticket per flight changed by American Airlines, that would be 4 flights changed for 4 people for a total of $800. Thank you. Sincerely, Katherine Rooks"
